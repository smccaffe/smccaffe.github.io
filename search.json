    "text": "Evolution 303\nby S. Shawn McCafferty\nWelcome to the beta draft (v0.1) of the OER-like text for BIO303 Evolution at Wheaton College. I put this OER-like text together specifically for the students in my BIO303 Evolution course for the S25 term. This text was based on lecture notes and slides developed over the twenty years of teaching BIO303 at Wheaton College, and was built off Michael Tobler’s outstanding OER text A Primer of Evolution.\nWhy “OER-like”? It is not my intention to make this document generally available since it is being written specifically for the students at Wheaton College. That being the case, since it is based on my notes and slides from over twenty years, including many images and ideas from numerous different commercial texts, some of the material is not properly cited, or at least at a level expected from a public OER under the Creative Commons guidelines. It simply is not worth my time to reach out to the publishers and authors to gain approval to use the images and ideas, so I use these images and ideas under the Fair Use concept with no intention of commercial value or copyright violation. It is my opinion that makes this not an OER document to be made publicly available, but an OER-like document akin to me making my slides available to my students.\nWhy “beta draft (v0.1)”? Following Michi’s lead using Bookdown, I am writing this document using the app Quarto (the next generation of Bookdown), which is taking a bit longer to work through than I anticipated. That plus getting kind of a late start on it translates into me not being able to complete the document and proof it properly before the start of the the upcoming S25 term. So, in my opinion, not really ready for prime time…yet.\nThe entire text is written using Qiarto, and formatted and optimized for HTML for online use. If you would prefer a PDF version, just let me know and I can render one for you, but the formatting will be a little off.\nI would like to thank Michael Tobler sharing his hard work with me and allowing me to “have at it”. In that spirit, I retain Michi’s name on the document as a co-author, though any errors are my own doing. Below I have included the Front Matters and Acknowledgments from his original OER since in my opinion they are just as relevant here.",

    "section": "",
    "text": "Part 1: Introduction to the basic concepts\nIn the first part of our journey, we will establish the basics of evolutionary biology. 1  What evolution is introduces the concept of evolution, beginning with a discussion on evolution as an emergent property of life, how we define evolution, and based on this definition some important about evolution. We end the chapter with a discussion of evolution as a Scientific Theory, and how our definition of evolution relates to Darwin’s Theory of Evolution. In 2  A brief history of evolutionary thought, we continue the discussion of Darwin and his theory of evolution from an historical perspective, briefly tracing the history of evolutionary thought pre-Darwin, Darwin’s publishing his seminal work On The Origin Of Species, his contributions to evolutionary theory, the six components of what we now consider Darwin’s Theory of Evolution, and continuing on through post-Darwin, including the direction of the field today. We end the Chapter with a very brief overview of some important concepts to keep in mind concerning evolution and natural selection. In 3  Evidence for Evolution we briefly discuss the overwhelming evidence for evolution, touching briefly on the varied evidences that demonstrate evolution as the only scientific explanation for the diversity of life on this planet. We end this section by circling back to Darwin’s mechanism of natural selection in 4  How Natural Selection Works, focusing on how the hypotheses of Darwin to Wallace can be tested using a classic example of Galapagos finches, followed by a discussion on the nature of natural selection and how to think about how selection works.\n\n\nPart 2: Evolutionary Trees and Phylogenetics\nThe second part explores one of the essential tools in understanding how evolution works, evolutionary trees. We begin by discussing the basics of evolutionary trees in 5  Understanding Evolutionary Trees, starting with what an evolutionary tree is, the anatomy and language used to describe trees, the types of trees, and how to interpret them correctly. We end the chapter with a discussion of how to map characters on evolutionary trees evoking the concept of parsimony and the importance of “tree thinking” in evolution. The next chapter 6  Estimating evolutionary trees provides a high fly-over of the methods used to construct evolutionary trees, the field of phylogenetics. We discuss the basic of tree estimation for both morphological and molecular characteristics, and end with a brief discussion of the uses of evolutionary trees today.\n\n\nPart 3: Evolutionary Genetics\nThe third part takes a 21st century perspective on evolution and closes a critical gap in Darwin’s original ideas—namely, the mechanisms underlying heredity. We will integrate your knowledge of modern genetics with evolutionary principles to analyze changes in the genetic composition of populations through time. ?sec-mutvar discusses the fuel that drives evolution, mutation, taking a classical approach, but also briefly venturing into a more nuanced, contemporary view of mutation informed by recent findings in modern molecular biology. We will also breifly explore how different types of mutations impact the expression of phenotypic traits and provide the raw material for evolutionary change. In addition, we will learn how evolutionary biologists quantify genetic variation in populations and use that data to infer whether or not evolutionary forces are acting on a population. We then ask what happens to that variation caused by mutations taking a classical population genetics approach, beginning with how to calculate allele frequencies and the null model for evolution (8  Introduction: Evolutionary genetics), then build off that null model to discuss how the mechanisms of genetics drift (9  Genetic Drift), selection (10  Mechanisms that drive evolution: natural selection), mutation (11  Mutation), migration (12  Migration and other factors), and a combination of these mechanims work to change allele frequencies in a population. We then shift our attention from these relatively simple, singe gene models to explore complex phenotypic characters in 13  The Evolution of Quantitative Traits, making the connection between the single gene models we just reviewed and complex phenotypic characters, the genome-phenome connection, and basic quantitative genetic approaches used to study the evolution of complex phenotypic traits controlled by many genes at once.\nTHE FOLLOWING NEEDS EDITING TO MATCH MY CLASS\n\n\nPart 4: In Light Of Evolution\nThe fourth part of the book explores the outcomes of natural selection and the other evolutionary forces discussed in Part 3. In xxxxx, we will focus on how evolution has shaped the social interactions between individuals of the same species, learning about kin and sexual selection. Chapter XXXXX focuses on how we can infer adaptation in natural populations. We will explore the concept of phenotypic plasticity, why it can complicate the inference of adaptation, and how plasticity itself can be the outcome of adaptive evolution. In Chapter XXXXX we wrap all these concepts together to investigate how new species arise, and speciation as a gradual process that is shaped by the same evolutionary forces that influence the evolution of phenotypic traits within species. We end this section by then exploring how the mechanisms of evolution work at the molecular and genomic level, and the role development plays in the evolution of complex characters and species.\n\n\nPART 5: Evolution At The Macro Level\n\n\nPart 6: What About Us\nThe last part of the book focuses on the application of evolutionary theory in the context of human nature and human health. Chapters 12 and Chapter 13 explore how evolutionary principles are applied in modern medicine. We will discuss why we age and how modern lifestyles are connected to the development of a wide variety of health conditions commonly named “diseases of civilization”. In addition, we will explore how a better understanding of pathogen evolution allows for the development of concrete management strategies that can impact the spread of diseases. Finally, Chapter 14 includes an overview of human origins and discusses how the sequencing of ancient DNA has shed new light into our own history.",

Rather, it is supposed to provide a succinct introduction to evolutionary thought revolving around theory, evidence, and practice:\n\nI will introduce some of the theoretical cornerstones and core concepts of modern evolutionary biology. The goal is for you to be able to apply these concepts and articulate testable hypotheses that explain natural phenomena from an evolutionary perspective.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPreface to Primer To Evolution\n\n\n\nby Michael Tobler\n\nIn the Light of Evolution\n\n“There is grandeur in this view of life, with its several powers, having been originally breathed by the Creator into a few forms or into one; and that, whilst this planet has gone cycling on according to the fixed law of gravity, from so simple a beginning endless forms most beautiful and most wonderful have been and are being evolved.”\n― Darwin, 1859\n\nThe concluding sentence of Charles Darwin’s paradigm-shifting book “The Origin of Species” has stuck with me ever since I first read it in my freshman year of college. Back then, I was passionate about two things: the wildflowers of the Alps in my home country of Switzerland, and the fishes I kept in my aquaria. They both offered an incredible diversity of forms to explore. On the one hand, there were bell flowers (Campanula sp.; Figure @ref(fig:campanula)) and gentians (Gentiana sp.) with exuberantly large and colorful flowers, snowbells (Soldanella sp.) that pushed their flowers through a cover of snow, and willow (Salix sp.) brushes that barely managed to grow ankle-high in the many decades of exposure to the harsh mountain climates. On the other hand, there were the cichlid fishes of Lake Malawi. Over 1,000 species in a single lake, all carrying their developing young in their mouths but otherwise so different in their body morphology, coloration, and feeding habits. Some species specialize on scraping off scales from the bodies of other fish, others adapted to prey exclusively on fish fry, ramming mouth-brooding females in the throat and gobbling up their offspring as they are released. It’s so wild that it seemed made up! I could get lost in exploring all the magnificent and weird things in nature. I still do sometimes; whether it’s by stomping around creeks, observing my fish, or browsing through books. And all along I have kept wondering: Why are there all of these forms? How do these critters function in their habitats? And how did they come about?\n\n\n\n\n\nCampanula scheuchzeri (Scheuchzer’s Bellflower) in the Swiss Alps. Photo: M. Tobler\n\n\n\n\nStudying evolutionary biology has helped me to address these questions. As a scientific discipline, evolutionary biology fundamentally seeks to understand biodiversity and its origins. Evolution is the unifying theory of biology because it provides a simple explanation for the patterns of similarities and differences we can observe among all living things, which ultimately forms the framework in which researchers across disciplines address questions about the living world. It does so by addressing both proximate and ultimate causes of organismal function. Proximate questions primarily focus on explaining organismal function in terms of intrinsic and environmental factors (these are sometimes referred to how questions). For example, when we consider a peacocks magnificent tail feathers and coloration, how did environmental cues and changes in hormone levels initiate the development of these secondary sexual traits, and what genes might be involved in controlling there expression? In contrast, ultimate questions explain organismal function in terms of the evolutionary forces acting on them (sometimes referred to as why questions): why did the peacock evolve its exuberant traits, what are the traits’ functions and how do they impact the fitness of its carrier?\nUnderstanding how organisms work, how their traits allow them to survive in the peculiar environments they find themselves in, and how those traits came to be did not take out the wonder out of my fascination with nature; rather, it filled me with a new level of appreciation for the intricacies of life. I think that is the grandeur Darwin was alluding to at the end of The Origin of Species. Or, as another famous evolutionary biologist put it:\n\n“Nothing in biology makes sense except in the light of evolution. […] Seen in the light of evolution, biology is, perhaps, intellectually the most satisfying and inspiring science. Without that light it becomes a pile of sundry facts, some of them interesting or curious, but making no meaningful picture as a whole.”\n― Dobzhansky, 1973\n\n\n\nBeyond Understanding Biodiversity\nSimply put, evolution is the change in heritable traits of populations that occurs across successive generations. Today, we have a nuanced understanding of the mechanisms that contribute to the evolutionary process. We are disentangling the genomic basis of traits relevant for organismal function, we are identifying the evolutionary forces—like natural selection—that determine what traits are passed on from one generation to the next, and we try to link these mechanisms to observable evolutionary outcomes, like adaptation, cooperation, and speciation. Applying these approaches has allowed us to explore many aspects of biodiversity, including the reasons behind sexual dimorphism, puzzling social behaviors, variation in life history traits, and even our own human origins.\nThe scientific reach of evolutionary biology, however, has long since eclipsed a basic understanding of the origins and function of biodiversity; the power of evolutionary analyses is now applied to address some of the major scientific challenges we face as a society: How will nature respond to the rapid environmental changes caused by human activities? How do we safeguard food production for a rapidly growing population? Why are there cancers and other diseases, and what can their origins tell us about prevention and treatment? How do we limit the spread of antibiotic-resistant pathogens? And how can we predict and limit the spread of emerging infectious diseases?\nDuring this semester, we will cover both basic and applied aspects of evolution. So whether you are a bit of a naturalist—like myself—who tries to better understand the world, or whether you aspire to address some of the major environmental and public health issues we face as a society, I hope you will find something to take away from this class.",

    "text": "1.1 Introduction to Evolutionary Biology\nEvolutionary biology stands as one of the most comprehensive and far-reaching disciplines within the biological sciences. It is the only scientific explanation for the diversification of life on earth. Its primary goals are to not just discover the history of life, but to understand the causes of diversity and characteristics in organisms, and apply evolutionary theory to explain biological phenomena. Unlike other areas of biology, which focus on proximate causes (immediate explanations for phenomena), evolutionary biology is concerned with ultimate causation, probing deeper into the long-term reasons behind biological diversity.\nEvolution provides a perspective that enriches and informs every field of biology, from molecular biology to ecology. As such, it serves as the central unifying theory. As Dobzhansky famously stated, “Nothing in biology makes sense except in the light of evolution.” Though there a good deal of misunderstanding in terms of what Dobzhansky actually meant by this (for example, see Griffiths (2008) or Giaimo (2023)), nonetheless this quote highlights the foundational role that evolutionary theory plays across all branches of biology. For this reason, evolution is much more than a “discipline” in the biological sciences. It is something much grander.\nDespite its centrality to biology, evolution is often misunderstood by a substantial portion of the general population. Recent polls indicate that around 60% to 65% of Americans believe that humans and other living things have evolved over time, an increase compared to just 35% around fifteen years ago. This actually is a reassuring statistic in that it implies an increasing acceptance of evolution. However, there is a notable partisan divide in beliefs about evolution, with the Pew Research Center reporting approximately 67% of Democrats and independents saying humans have evolved, compared to only 43% of Republicans. This gap has tended to widened over time, which is rather troubling.\nWhat are the drivers of these misunderstandings concerning evolution and its role in the natural world? Clearly there are a variety of causes, the most important being religious or political influences and poor representation of evolution in educational curricula. Many Americans who accept evolution also believe that God played a role in guiding the process. About 24% think that a supreme being guided evolution, while 35% attribute it to natural processes like natural selection. Though the polling data suggest an increasing (or at least stable) level of acceptance of evolution in the last decade or so, these findings highlight the complex interplay between education, religion, and political ideology in shaping public acceptance of evolutionary theory in the United States.\nAnother issue driving misunderstandings of evolution is the varied meanings of the word “evolution” itself in non-biological contexts, leading to confusion by the general population. For that reason alone, it is crucial that we start our discussion of evolutionary theory with a clear and unambiguous definition.",

    "section": "1.2 Defining Evolution",
    "text": "1.2 Defining Evolution\nAt its broadest, evolution simply means “change” (from the Latin root evolvere, meaning unfolding or unrolling). However, this word change in of itself is really much too simplistic and vague to capture the biological concept of evolution. In biological terms, evolution specifically refers to the change in heritable traits across generations. Darwin described evolution as “descent with modification,” meaning that traits are passed down from one generation to the next, often with some variation, leading to diversification over time. These two statements make for a good starting point for coming up with a working definition for evolution that is both necessary and sufficient. However, before we settle on a formal definition, let’s take a few minutes to think a little about evolution as something a more than a scientific theory, but as an emergent property of all living things.\n\nEvolution as an emergent property\nI would argue that not only is evolution the explanation for the diversity of life on earth, but that it is an emergent property of what we call life, and therefore inescapable. The argument goes something like this:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportant\n\n\n\nConsider a system that has four general properties:\n\nThere is group of similar entities that make copies of themselves (i.e. reproduce) in some manner.\nSome characteristic varies to some extent among the individuals making up this group.\nThere is some mechanism whereby the next generation of entities (offspring) tend to resemble their parent(s) to some degree.\nFinally, there is a sorting process whereby some individuals make it to the next generation but others do not. This sorting process can be one of two types\n\nstochastic, whereby whether an individual makes it into the subsequent generation is completely random.\ndeterministic, such that the value of characteristic (that varies among individuals) determines in some capacity whether the individual makes it into the subsequent generation.\n\n\n\n\nThe nature of this system does not really matter, so long as it has all four of the above properties. It could be something completely inorganic and not what we define as life, say for example a group of very similar computer programs that were coded to all do the same thing, plus they are self replicating (make copies of themselves every generation), or it could be some non-carbon based life form beyond our current understanding. Does not matter. All that matters us that the system has the four above properties.\nWhat would happen to this group of entities over time given the above conditions? It should be quite clear: the percentage of the group made up of different forms of the variable characteristic will change over time. The frequency (percentage in the population of programs) of the various versions of the character will increase or decrease over time; some versions may even completely disappear, all dependent on the sorting process (plus a few other important considerations). These changes may occur quickly or slowly, be large or subtle, but they will occur. It is a natural consequence of a system with these four properties.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nYou can simulate this system easily and satisfyingly with large bag of blue and white Wheaton M&Ms. Can you figure out how?\n\n\nThis process, whereby we see a change in the percentage of the group made up of certain versions of the character over time, is what we call evolution. Any system with these four characteristics will undergo this process. It is inescapable (so long as the system has all four characteristics). It is in fact an emergent property of this system.\n\n\nEvolution as an emergent property of life\nFor the above argument we described a very generalized system. Now let’s make specific to biological systems. To restate the four properties relative to a biological system, we would phrase them as:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportant\n\n\n\n\nA population of individual organisms (of the same species).\nVariation among individuals in the population for some characteristic, be it molecular or phenotypic (i.e. mutation).\nThe character has a genetic basis such that changes in the genome (mutations) that determine that character are passed on to offspring (in other words heritable similarity, or inheritance).\nSorting process occur every generation, which from a biological perspective can be either:\n\nRandom or stochastic, what is referred to as genetic drift\nDeterministic, what is referred to as natural selection\n\n\n\n\nIn this case, the end result is what we refer to as organic evolution, a change in frequency of a heritable character in a population over time. As in the general system described previously, it is inevitable, inescapable (so long as four criteria are present), and an emergent property of life.\nThat being the case, it makes little sense to argue that evolution does not happen, as for example creationists would propose. The very fact that organisms are biological entities guarantees they will evolve. It is…inevitable.",

    "section": "1.3 Formalizing what evolution is",
    "text": "1.3 Formalizing what evolution is\nTo summarize, for evolution to occur, several conditions must be met:\n\nThere must be a population of entities.\nVariation must exist among the individuals in the population.\nTraits must be heritable, meaning offspring resemble their parents.\nA sorting process must take place, where certain traits increase or decrease in frequency within the population.\n\nThese processes together drive evolution, with populations of organisms—such as species—undergoing genetic changes over time. The mechanisms of inheritance ensure that traits are passed on, while mutation introduces the necessary variation. Evolutionary sorting mechanisms include both random processes (such as genetic drift) and non-random processes like natural selection. As we will see later, there are other important mechanisms that drive evolution. This is important to recognize: that evolution can occur without the action of natural selection (e.g. by stochastic sorting (genetic drift). However, it is only natural selection that leads to the evolution of adaptations—improvements in the function of traits.\n\nA working definition for evolution\nWe often find evolution defined in the following way:\n\ndescent with modification of heritable variation from a common ancestor over time (often followed by diversification)\n\nThis is a fine definition, and you will see some form of this definition in just about every evolution text out there. Science being science, it probably comes as no surprise to you that there have been numerous other definitions proposed over the decades since Darwin, some better than others. Here is a very brief list of a few from some popular undergraduate biology texts:\n\n\nthe change in the properties of populations of organisms, or groups of such populations, over the course of generations\nchange in hereditary characteristics of group of organisms over the course of generations\ndescent with modification of different lineages from common ancestors\nongoing adaptation of organisms to environmental challenges and change\n\n\nUnfortunately in many undergraduate texts or online resources you may find, the definition of evolution specifically states natural selection as the driving mechanism. That is unfortunate if not down right incorrect. You can have evolution occurring without the action of natural selection, as we mentioned above, so for that reason alone, we want to avoid adopting definitions that specficy natural selection.\nA very popular definition that has increased in acceptance over the last couple of decades is “the change in gene frequencies over time”, or more accurately “the change in allele frequencies over time”. This definition is appealing to most researchers since any change in the frequency of the heritable character will result in a change in the frequency of alleles at the gene or genes that contribute to that character, making it an appealing mechanistic definition.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nThe desire for a mechanistic definition of evolution makes good sense. A mechanistic definition means basically “if you see it, you have it”, which is why this definition increased in popularity since the molecular revolution for obvious reasons. While many evolutionary biologists seem to prefer “change in gene frequencies over time”, in my opinion such a strict mechanistic approach can sometimes lead to minimizing some very important processes such as the role of gene regulation and development in the evolutionary process, and the complexities of the genome-phenotype connection. As we continue our discussion of evolution throughout this OER, we will explore some of these complexities, and perhaps my opinion will make a little more sense.\n\n\nWhen considering this definition today, we should take a very broad definition of what a gene and an allele is. Specifically, a gene is usually formally defined either in the Mendelian sense as a basic unit of inheritance, while a more contemporary definition would be any region of a genome that codes for a functional RNA. An allele is defined as a variant form of a gene. Unfortunately, if strictly interpreted this definition can lead to some confusion since it seems to imply that changes in the frequency of variants outside gene regions that may have no obvious phenotypic effect (e.g. simple nucleotide changes in regions of the genome that contribute nothing to the functioning of an organism) are not considered to be evolution, and that most certainly is NOT the case.\nSounds like nit-picking, but in the natural sciences, language matters; and it most definitely matters when discussing evolution. Clear and concise definitions go far in avoiding misunderstanding and misrepresentation.\nPerhaps a better definition might be something along the lines of “change in the frequency of any genomic variation in a population over time”. Thanks to recent advances in our understanding of genomes and how they function, this definition allows us to move away from a specific focus on genes and alleles to encompass all manner of variation that characterizes genomes, from Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNPs) found in coding, noncoding, regulatory, and intergenic regions (between genes), to small and large Structural Variants (SV). It is not even necessary that this kind of variation effects a phenotypic characteristic (though if it does not it may be difficult to see how selection could act on it, but it can). So long as it is variation in the genome that gets passed on from parents to offspring, if it changes over generations, it is evolution (by specifiying this I am purposely excluding epigenetic variation, even though epigenetic changes can be passed on across a limited number of generations and can impact phenotypes). We will explore these types of variants more in the later chapters.\nAdmittedly, the above definition is not very graceful; it does not really role off the tongue. Perhaps we should just leave it as the change in the frequency of heritable variation in a population over time; not particularly specific, but with plenty of wiggle room to accommodate all the exciting and very cool changes that we are finding in genomes today.\nAnd this kind of closes the loop on our discussion of how best to define evolution since this definition is our original one given above.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nSo which definition is best? Personally, so long as the definition encapsulates the essential components of change, heritable variation, population, and over time, I am good with it.",

    "text": "1.4 Some important points from our definition of evolution\nLet go back to a very common definition of evolution found in many text books sometimes mistakenly attributed to Darwin:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\ndescent with modification of heritable variation over time (oftentimes followed by diversification)\n\n\nWe can break the above definition into three key concepts\n\ndescent with modification (change)\nheritable variation\nover time\n\nConsidering our discussion above, it is obvious why the definition includes these three key concepts. Notice though what is not specified in this definition\n\nIt says nothing about the origin of life. Though evolutionary theory can provide profound insights into how life on earth may have started, it does not necessarily need to explain the origin of life on earth. Evolution occurs the moment life has begun, by whatever process. For that reason criticizing evolutionary theory because it does not explain how life began is not a valid criticism.\nIt says nothing about the formation of a new species. It is important to note that evolution does not equate to the formation of new species. Evolution certainly can lead to new species as we will see in later chapters, but it is not what defines evolution per se. This common misunderstanding is often exploited by those who reject evolutionary theory. Evolution encompasses much more than speciation; it is a broader process of change within populations over time. Any change in the frequency of a genomic variant in a population over time is evolution, and it need not lead to the formation of a new species.\nFor the above reasons, my preference is to refer to evolution as THE explanation for the diversification of life on earth. Not the catchiest of memes, but probably the most accurate.\nEvolution is not the same as natural selection. Without a doubt, natural selection can lead to evolution, but not always. As mentioned above, evolution can happen due to other mechanisms beside natural selection. If these two statements do not make sense to you, hopefully they will after we discuss the nature of natural selection and the mechanisms that drive evolution a little later.\nFrom a long-term perspective, evolution describes the branching of lineages from common ancestors (macroevolution). In the short term, it describes the diversification and oftentimes adaptation of organisms to environmental challenges (microevolution). Both micro- and macroevolution are evolution, neither more or less important than the other. In fact, there is a good argument to make that macroevolution is natural extrapolation of the same processes that drive microevolution, and therefore they describe the same thing.\nThere is no such thing as de-evolution. There is no “forward” or “reverse” in evolution. Describing evolutionary change as directional (either forward or reverse) rests on the flawed interpretation that evolution is driving systems in some a priori direction, some end point, some kind of goal. It does not. That would be what is often called “teleological thinking”, which is a topic we are best advised to tread softly by (Kampourakis (2020)). Evolution is simply change over time, and though it can appear to be moving toward some goal, for example complexity, it need not be. Change is change, and if that change leads to the loss of a characteristic that evolved earlier in lineages or ancestors, that is simply evolution; nothing “de-” about it. The only phenomena I would interpret as deevolution would be extinction, the complete undoing of an evolutionary lineage.",

    "text": "1.5 In closing\nArmed with a good working definition of what evolution is, it is worth discussing what exactly we mean the Theory of Evolution before moving on.\nEvolution is a concept that often sparks confusion regarding its scientific status. While biologists frequently refer to the “theory of evolution,” this terminology carries a different weight in scientific circles compared to its colloquial usage. In other words, we need to go back to your basic introductory biology course on what we mean by the word theory in the natural sciences.\n\nScientific Terminology\nIn the realm of science, terms like hypothesis, fact, and theory have specific meanings that may well differ from common parlance:\nHypothesis: An informed conjecture or statement about what might be true. It’s the starting point for scientific inquiry.\nFact: This can refer to simple, confirmed observations or hypotheses that have garnered substantial supporting evidence. Facts, however, are not immutable and can be revised in light of new evidence. However, this does not mean that alternative facts are a real thing.\nTheory: Unlike its everyday usage suggesting an unsupported speculation, a scientific theory is a comprehensive, coherent body of interconnected statements explaining various aspects of nature. It’s based on reasoning, evidence, and empirical data, and is considered a pinnacle achievement in science.\nThere is a tendency in the general population to equate the common use of the term theory with the a Scientific Theory, as in “Evolution is only a theory, and there are other equally valid alternative theories that should be presented”. This is further complicated by the common mistake of conflating theory (in common parlance) and hypothesis. Let’s address this one first.\nThere is a big difference between an hypothesis (as defined above) and a theory in the common sense; that is, there is a big difference between “an informed conjecture” versus “an unsupported speculation”. In science we usually base hypothesis on some level of pre-existing knowledge and information that lends itself to testing, while in the common use of the term theory, it more based on an individuals personal opinion. These are not, or at least should not be, considered equals. You can though easily imagine a (lower case) theory becoming an hypothesis if it contains aspects that lend themselves to testing of predictions. And that is the critical difference; good hypotheses naturally lend themselves to testing through the formulations of predictions, design of experiments to test those predictions, and the collection of empirical data that can be either of in support of those predictions or not. That is natural science. That is the difference between an hypothesis, and an opinion.\nA Scientific Theory on the other hand is the firmest of ground in the natural sciences. To say something is a Scientific Theory means we are about as confident as we can be in the natural sciences that this is the explanation of some natural phenomena. Upper case “Theory” is a term of honor in science. As scientists, we should never hesitate to make this distinction when discussing a Scientific Theory with non-scientists.\n\n\nDarwin’s Theory of Evolution: From Hypothesis to Theory\nDarwin’s work in “The Origin of Species” proposed two major hypotheses:\n\nOrganisms have descended, with modification, from common ancestors.\nNatural selection acting on hereditary variation is the chief cause of modification.\n\nThe first hypothesis has since been overwhelmingly confirmed numerous times by evidence from various scientific disciplines, elevating it to the status of a Scientific Theory.\nThe explanation of how modification occurs and how ancestors give rise to diverse descendants constitutes the scientific theory of evolution. This theory encompasses more causes than Darwin initially proposed, including mutation, recombination, gene flow, isolation, and random genetic drift in addition to natural selection.\n\n\nThe Nature of Scientific Theories\nLike all scientific theories, evolutionary theory is a work in progress. While core principles have withstood rigorous scrutiny, frontier areas continue to be actively researched. However, uncertainty in these frontier areas does not undermine the well-established core of the theory.\nThe main tenets of evolutionary theory - descent with modification from a common ancestor, partly caused by natural selection - are so robustly supported that they form the foundation of modern biological science.\nIn summary evolution is not just a theory, it is a Scientific Theory. I would venture to say that evolution is more than a Scientific Theory, it is indeed a fact, an inescapable emergent property of life. And even more than that, it is a paradigm.\n\n\nDarwin’s Theory of Evolution\nArmed with a good working definition of what evolution is, how does this relate to Darwin’s Theory of Evolution? After all, when most non-scientists think about evolution, if they even do, they think Darwin, that he “discovered” evolution. Well, not really. We will discuss Darwin and his insights and contributions a little more in the next chapter on the history of evolutionary thinking.\n\n\n\n\nGiaimo, Stefano. 2023. “On Citing Dobzhansky about the Significance of Evolution to Biology.” Integrative Organismal Biology 5 (1). https://doi.org/10.1093/iob/obac047.\n\n\nGriffiths, Paul Edmund. 2008. “In What Sense Does ‘Nothing Make Sense Except in the Light of Evolution’?” Acta Biotheoretica 57 (1-2): 11–32. https://doi.org/10.1007/s10441-008-9054-9.\n\n\nKampourakis, Kostas. 2020. “Students’ “Teleological Misconceptions” in Evolution Education: Why the Underlying Design Stance, Not Teleology Per Se, Is the Problem.” Evolution: Education and Outreach 13 (1). https://doi.org/10.1186/s12052-019-0116-z.",

    "text": "2.1 Prior To Darwin\nHistorically, humanity has been intrigued by the origins of life from fairly early on in written history. Early Greek philosophers such as Anaximander (6th century BC) believed that living creatures originated from water, with humans and animals descending from fish. Similarly, Empedocles (5th century BC) proposed that body parts combined randomly to form creatures, with only viable combinations surviving. These ideas, however, were not scientific precursors to the theory of evolution but more akin to mythology.\nPhilosophers like Plato and Aristotle held the belief that species were fixed and unchanging. Plato suggested that every species had a fixed essence, an eternal idea in the mind of God, while Aristotle asserted that species possessed immutable properties.\nThese ideas influenced later Christian interpretations, particularly the belief that God created every creature with a distinct essence as described in the biblical account of creation in the book of Genesis (purportedly written by Moses). Accordingly so, all types of plants and animals reproduce “according to their kind”, which implicitly precludes evolution as a process driving the diversity of life.\nThe concept of life was seen as a hierarchical scala Naturae, ranging from inanimate objects to higher life forms, with humans positioned between animals and angels.\nThis hierarchy was believed to be eternal and unchanging, as any alteration would imply imperfection in God’s original creation.\nDarwin’s theory posed a significant challenge to the prevailing worldview at the time, which had its roots in the philosophies of Plato, Aristotle, and subsequent christian beliefs that stressed the concept of species possessing immutable (unchanging) characteristics. However, even before Darwin there were hints of a shift toward “evolutionary thinking”.\nThe first traces of true evolutionary thinking can be found back in the 18th and 19th centuries, when natural history began to shift from a religious perspective to a more scientific approach. During this period, naturalists like Carolus Linnaeus (1707-1778) made significant contributions to the field of taxonomy, although their work was still framed within a creationist worldview.\nLinnaeus, renowned for his comprehensive classification system outlined in Systema Naturae (1735), organized species into hierarchical categories based on their perceived relationships. However, his understanding of these relationships was rooted in the idea of a divine creation plan rather than evolutionary connections.",

    "text": "Pre-Darwiian non-western concepts of evolution\nThough most histories of “evolutionary thinking” pre-Darwin emphasize the western world, several pre-Darwinian concepts of evolution emerged from Islamic and Eastern philosophical traditions, demonstrating that evolutionary ideas were not exclusive to Western thought. For example:\n\nThe Islamic scholar Al-Jahiz (776-869 AD) Al-Jahiz, in his work “Kitab al-Hayawan” (Book of Animals), discussed several concepts that resemble modern evolutionary theory, including the struggle for existence, adaptation to environmental factors, and transformation of species. He proposed that animals engage in a struggle for resources and survival, with environmental factors influencing the development of new characteristics.\nIbn Miskawaih (932-1030 AD) who presented a theory of biological evolution in his book “Al-Fauz al-Asghar” (The Small Achievement). He believed in the aquatic origin of life and described an evolutionary process, albeit attributing it to the Creator.\nAl-Biruni’s (973-1048 AD) writings have been interpreted by some scholars as containing evolutionary ideas. His work influenced later Muslim scientists and potentially contributed to the development of evolutionary thought.\nA 10th-century Islamic encyclopedia entitled “The Encyclopedia of the Brethren of Purity” expanded on the concept of the great chain of being. It proposed a causal relationship advancing up the chain as the mechanism of creation, starting from matter and energy, progressing to minerals, and eventually to more complex forms of life.\nIn his work “Muqaddimah,” Ibn Khaldun (1332-1406) discussed what some commentators interpret as anticipating biological evolution. He asserted that humans developed from “the world of the monkeys” and described a process by which “species become more numerous”.\n\nWhile these pre-Darwinian concepts share some similarities with modern evolutionary theory, it’s important to note that they differ in significant ways. First, many of these ideas were speculative rather than based on extensive empirical evidence, a coming hallmark of western science. In addition, they often incorporated religious or philosophical elements not present in Darwin’s scientific theory. And certainly the mechanism of natural selection, central to Darwin’s theory, was not fully developed in these earlier concepts. Nevertheless, these pre-Darwinian ideas demonstrate that evolutionary thinking has a rich history across various cultures and philosophical traditions.

    "text": "2.2 The Enlightenment and Scientific Progress\nThe Enlightenment movement, inspired by Isaac Newton’s scientific explanations, played a crucial role in challenging the literal interpretation of biblical creation. This philosophical shift paved the way for the emergence of modern scientific thought and laid the groundwork for evolutionary theories.\nAstronomers and geologists were instrumental in this process, providing evidence for the ancient age of the Earth and the existence of extinct species The principle of uniformitarianism, proposed by geologists James Hutton and Charles Lyell, suggested that present-day processes could explain past geological changes. It can not be stressed enough the profound impact Lyell’s writing had on Darwin’s thinking on evolution.\n\nEarly Evolutionary Ideas\nIn the 18th century, French philosophers and naturalists began proposing natural explanations for the origin of species, moving away ever so slightly from special creation as found in the Judeo-Christian bible.\nGeorges Cuvier (1769-1832), known as the father of paleontology, opposed evolutionary ideas, emphasizing instead the concept of organic succession. In addition to paleontology, Cuvier championed method of comparative anatomy, and proposed that Earth was very old (certainly older than the 7,000 years proposed by the Bishop of Usher based on the geneologies found within Genesis) with a history punctuated by “revolutions” (catastrophes). He argued that while species appeared and disappeared over epochs, this did not result from evolution but rather from distinct, successive creations. In Cuvier we find the first inklings of movement from the biblical interpretation of the creation to something a little other.\nThe idea of evolution remained controversial, and most naturalists adhered to “natural theology,” as illustrated by William Paley’s Natural Theology (1802), which argued for the existence of a divine creator based on the complexity of organisms.\nThe first real cracks in the edifice of creationism was the pre-Darwinian evolutionary hypothesis came from the Chevalier de Lamarck in his 1809 work “Philosophie Zoologique”.\nLamarck’s theory suggested that:\n\nOrganisms originated separately through spontaneous generation.\nA “nervous fluid” drove species to progress up a chain of being.\nSpecies differences arose from varying needs and organ usage.\nAcquired characteristics could be inherited by offspring.\n\nThis concept of inheritance of acquired characteristics became known as Lamarckism, though the idea was not Lamarck’s uniquely. A classic example of this theory is the explanation for giraffe neck elongation, where repeated stretching to reach higher foliage was thought to result in longer necks over generations.\nWhile Lamarck’s specific mechanisms were later disproved, his work represents the first coherent and testable evolutionary theory, marking an important step in the development of evolutionary biology. In addition, even though his ideas of acquired inheritance, though soundly rejected, have taken on a new interpretation today in light of recent findings of the role of epigenetic changes and their impact on organismal adaptation and evolution.\nThere were other notable natural historians that contributed in one way or another to the shift from a purely biblical interpretation of special creation to moving down the path of evolution. You can check out the links below of you would like to learn more. The bottom line is that the concept of change over time, or transmutation as it was referred to, or evolution today, was “in the air” when Darwin came on the scene. However, Darwin’s theory of evolution marked the fundamental challenge of these long-held beliefs by solidifying the concept of species change over time, thereby disrupting the notion of a fixed and immutable natural order. This revolutionary idea forced a reevaluation of humanity’s place in the natural world and the mechanisms driving biological diversity.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSome additional links if you are interested in learning more about the history of evolutionary thinking\n\n\n\nHistory of evolutionary thinking\nWikipaedia entry on the History of evolutionary thinking",

    "section": "2.3 And then there was Darwin",
    "text": "2.3 And then there was Darwin\nby Michi Tobler\nCharles Darwin, born in 1809, was a pivotal figure in the history of science whose work revolutionized our understanding of life on Earth. Initially destined for a career in medicine and then the clergy, Darwin’s true passion lay in natural history. His life took a dramatic turn when he embarked on a five-year voyage aboard the HMS Beagle in 1831, serving as the ship’s naturalist.\n\nThe Voyage that Changed Everything\nDuring his journey, Darwin made extensive observations and collected numerous specimens, particularly in South America and the Galápagos Islands. It was here that he noticed intriguing variations in species across different islands, such as mockingbirds and giant tortoises. These observations, combined with his findings of fossil mammals in South America, planted the seeds of his evolutionary theory.\n\n\nDarwin and the Conception of a New Idea\nWhen Darwin boarded the British Navy Ship HMS Beagle as a 22-year old, he was already well trained in geology, chemistry, and natural history. Darwin was hired as an unofficial naturalist and companion to the captain of the ship, Robert FitzRoy, and the five-year journey around the world allowed young Darwin to collect evidence of a changing world (Figure @ref(fig:beaglemap)).\n\n\n\n\n\nMap of the Voyage of the Beagle. Map: Sémhur, CC BY-SA 4.0.\n\n\n\n\nDarwin’s visit to the Galapagos Islands, and the specimens of reptiles and birds that he collected there, proved to be particularly inspiring. The Galapagos are an archipelago of 21 small islands, located over 900 kilometers off the coast of Ecuador, and situated right on the equator. Darwin not only noticed that the fauna of these islands was dominated by animals found nowhere else, but there also were differences in the species from one island to the next. Most importantly, bird specimens that Darwin believed to be blackbirds, warblers, wrens, and finches due to their different beak morphologies later all turned out to be just finches—the Darwin’s finches we know today (Figure @ref(fig:finches)). In his own words:\n\n“I have stated, that in the thirteen species of ground-finches, a nearly perfect gradation may be traced, from a beak extraordinarily thick, to one so fine, that it may be compared to that of a warbler. […] Seeing this gradation and diversity of structure in one small, intimately related group of birds, one might really fancy that from an original paucity of birds in this archipelago, one species had been taken and modified for different ends.”\n— Darwin, 1889\n\nIf all the species were created with traits that fit the environments in which they are now found, why would the finches of the Galapagos Islands be so different from one another? Why do closely related species occupy niches that are filled by very different taxa in other regions? Observations like these, which Darwin made at many destinations throughout his travels, led him to suspect that the species we observe today have evolved from a shared ancestor.\n\n\n\n\n\nExamples of Darwin’s finches or Galapagos finches. Note the stark variation in beak sizes among the four species. Drawn by John Gould, Public Domain.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Birth of a Revolutionary Idea\nUpon his return to England, Darwin devoted himself to scientific work, thanks to his comfortable financial situation. In 1838, inspired by Thomas Malthus’ essay on population growth, Darwin conceived the groundbreaking idea of natural selection. This concept suggested that organisms with favorable traits would be more likely to survive and reproduce, gradually altering the characteristics of a species over time.\n\n\nFrom Conception to Publication\nDarwin spent the next two decades meticulously developing his theory and gathering evidence. His caution in publishing was well-founded, given the controversial nature of his ideas. In a twist of fate, Alfred Russel Wallace, a young naturalist, independently conceived a similar theory in 1858. This prompted Darwin to finally publish his work.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAlfred Russel Wallace\n\n\n\nDarwin described evolution as descent with modification. It turns out that he was not the only one to think about the ever-changing world in this way. Another prominent naturalist of the time, Alfred Russel Wallace, independently conceived the theory of evolution through natural selection. Like Darwin, Wallace conducted extensive fieldwork in the tropics and was a meticulous observer of the natural world. In 1858, Wallace wrote a letter to Darwin—who was by then an eminent scholar but had not published his views on evolution yet—detailing his own ideas about natural selection. This led to the joint publication of short abstracts detailing Darwin’s and Wallace’s views of evolution, and more importantly, it motivated Darwin to finish and publish his famous work, On the Origin of Species, in 1859. So, why does most of the credit for formalizing evolutionary theory go to Darwin rather than Wallace? Well, Darwin was undoubtedly first, ruminating on his ideas about evolution for decades before deciding to publish. As a consequence, he was able to introduce his views in much richer detail and provided many lines of evidence in support of his theory.\nTo learn more about Alfred Russel Wallace, listen to “He Helped Discover Evolution, And Then Became Extinct”, an NPR story published on the 100th anniversary of his death.\n\n\n\n\n\nFront page from On The Origin of Species",

    "section": "2.4 On The Origin of Species",
    "text": "2.4 On The Origin of Species\nby Michi Tobler & Shawn McCafferty\nOn November 24, 1859, Darwin’s seminal work, “On the Origin of Species by Means of Natural Selection,” was published, catapulting him to both fame and controversy.\nFrom the perspective of evolutionary biology, Darwin made three great contributions that were published in On the Origin of Species.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThree major contributions of Darwin presented in OTOS\n\n\n\n\nPresented overwhelming evidence for evolution.\nEvolution occurs by divergence from common ancestor, and can be represented as an evolutionary tree.\nProposed a mechanism for evolution, natural selection.\n\n\n\nFor the remainder of his life, Darwin continued his scientific pursuits, revising his magnum opus and publishing numerous other works, including “The Descent of Man”. His legacy is that of a man with an insatiable curiosity about the natural world, whose keen observations and innovative thinking led to a unified understanding of life’s diversity. His theory of evolution by natural selection remains a cornerstone of modern biology, shaping our understanding of life on Earth to this day. However, it is important to remember that Darwin was a man of his times, and though quite progressive for the Victorian Era, nonetheless maintained ideas concerning race and gender that today would be considered offensive and racist. (find a reference for this)\n\nDarwin’s Two Fundamental Insights\nIn his endeavors of pigeon breeding, Darwin noticed two critical things: (1) Offspring tended to inherit the traits of their parents. (2) If he carefully selected breeders with desired traits generation after generation, he was able to shape the variation of colors, morphology, and behaviors in his flock. It was observations such as this, coupled with his meticulous work as a natural historian and collecting evidence for his emerging ideas for over two decades, that ultimately led Darwin to formulate the basic tenets of evolutionary biology that still hold up today, after more than 150 years of scrutiny by the scientific community.\n\nThe Pattern: Evolution is Descent with Modification\nThe first of Darwin’s fundamental insights was the formal description of evolution as we understand it today. He described evolution as descent with modification, postulating the common ancestry of all living things. Hence, different species did not arise independently, but they derived from preexisting form. This insight arose from a careful analysis of patterns of similarities across species. Species that share a recent common ancestor share traits precisely because they inherited them from the shared ancestor. More distantly related taxa exhibit differences in their traits, because they have been on independent evolutionary trajectories for longer periods of time. This perspective describes the observable pattern of evolution.\nThe power of Darwin’s idea of descent with modification is that we can treat it as a scientific hypothesis with empirically testable predictions. If Darwin’s notion of evolution was right, we should be able to uncover evidence that:\n\nSpecies change through time (microevolution).\nLineages split to form new species (speciation).\nNovel forms derive from earlier forms (macroevolution).\nSpecies are not independent but connected by descent from a common ancestor (common ancestry and homology).\nEarth and life on Earth are old (deep time).\n\nWe will revisit these predictions and examine the evidence for evolution in the next chapter on the evidence of evolution.\n\n\nThe Process: Natural Selection is a Mechanism of Evolution\nThe second of Darwin’s fundamental insights was the inception of a mechanism that could produce the observable pattern we call evolution (i.e., change in inherited traits across generations), which Darwin named natural selection.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nDefinition: Natural Selection\nNatural selection is the process in which individuals with a particular trait exhibit higher reproductive success than individuals without that trait.\n\n\nNatural selection explains how the traits of a population change through time, and why organisms are well suited for their environment. Individuals that exhibit traits that are advantageous under certain environmental conditions have a higher chance of surviving and reproducing, making a disproportional contribution to the offspring of the next generation. If the relevant traits are heritable, their frequency increases across subsequent generations. This process not only leads to change in populations across generations, but said change specifically pertains to traits that are important for survival and reproduction in a given environmental context. In other words, the action of natural selection directly leads to adaptation. We will take a close look at how natural selection works in chapter XXXX and others.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDistinguishing between Pattern and Process\n\n\n\nA key misconception is that evolution and natural selection are the same. People often use the two terms interchangeably, conflating patterns and processes of evolution. Distinguishing between the two is critical, because evolution and natural selection do not have to go in unison.\nEvolution is a historical pattern of change that can—but does not have to—be caused by natural selection. Evolutionary change can also be driven by other forces that impact the composition of populations across generations. In Part II of this book, we will examine evolutionary forces other than natural selection, which include mutation, genetic drift, and migration. In natural populations, these four forces interact to shape evolutionary change across time.\nIt is also important to note that the action of natural selection does not necessarily lead to evolution. Natural selection can only cause evolution when it acts on heritable traits that are transmitted from parent to offspring. If that is the case, the offspring of successful individuals will carry the same traits that made their parents successful. However, not all traits are heritable. For example, selection on individuals exhibiting high muscle mass does not translate to evolutionary change if that muscle mass was acquired through exercise and diet. If natural selection acts on non-heritable traits, there is no evolutionary change.\nWhile Darwin’s hypothesis of common descent was quickly accepted, his idea of natural selection faced resistance due to philosophical biases and gaps in understanding heritability. Competing theories like Neo-Lamarckism and mutationism arose but were gradually integrated or disproven as more evidence supported Darwin’s theory.",

    "section": "2.5 Darwin’s Theory of Evolution",
    "text": "2.5 Darwin’s Theory of Evolution\nDarwin’s theory of evolution, though simple in its core principles, revolutionized our understanding of life. As we understand evolution today, it can be summarized as: life on Earth evolved gradually, beginning with a primitive species—possibly a self-replicating molecule—that lived more than 3.5 billion years ago. Over time, this species diversified into the many forms of life we see today, with natural selection being the primary mechanism for evolutionary change. (Coyne (2009))\nToday we recognize that Darwin’s Theory of Evolution is actually made up of six distinct components. As detailed in Futuyma and Fitzpatrick, they are:\n\nEvolution as such is the simple proposition that the characteristics of organisms change over time. Darwin was not the first to have this idea, but he so convincingly marshaled the evidence for evolution that most scientists soon accepted that it has indeed occurred.\nCommon descent: Differing radically from Lamarck, Darwin was the first to argue that species had diverged from common ancestors and that species could be portrayed as one great family tree representing actual ancestry.\nGradualism is Darwin’s proposition that the differences between even radically different organisms have evolved by small steps through intermediate forms, not by leaps (“saltations”).\nPopulational change is Darwin’s hypothesis that evolution occurs by changes in the proportions (frequencies) of different variant kinds of individuals within a population (see Figure 1.6B). Prior to Darwin, scholars viewed individual organisms as imperfect representations of a central Platonic type (the perfect manifestation of a species). Variation among individuals was considered to be meaningless noise that was either ignored or seen as a nuisance when describing and classifying species. In contrast, population thinking rejects the notion of an ideal representative and instead focus on the variants found within populations. Variation among individuals is not just meaningless noise that represents different degrees of imperfections from a preconceived idea, but it is the raw material for evolutionary change. In other words, what was meaningless noise to naturalists prior to Darwin suddenly became the very focus of evolutionary studies after. This profoundly important, completely original idea contrasts with the sudden origin of new species by saltation and with Lamarckian transformation of individuals. For Darwin, the average was a statistical abstraction; there exist only varied individuals, and there are no fixed limits to the variation that a species may undergo. Mayr (1982) argued that this paradigm shift was one of Darwin’s most important contributions to modern biology.\nNatural selection was Darwin’s brilliant hypothesis, independently conceived by Wallace, that accounts for adaptations, features that appear “designed” to fit organisms to their environment. Because it provided an entirely natural, mechanistic explanation for adaptive design that had previously been attributed to a divine intelligence, the concept of natural selection revolutionized not only biology, but Western thought as a whole.\n\nTo these five we can add a sixth component, which is not directly attributable to Darwin, but as will become apparent throughout the semester, plays an absolutely essential role in evolution, so it is important to include it here.\n\nNon-selective mechanisms: Evolution is also influenced by random factors, such as genetic drift or mutations.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA slightly different take on the six components of Darwin’s Theory of Evoution from the Mordern Synthesis\n\n\n\n\nEvolution itself: Over time, groups of organisms change based on changes in their DNA.\nGradualism: Evolution occurs over generations, not necessarily slowly but consistently over time.\nSpeciation: New species arise from the splitting of populations into groups that become distinct enough from each other.\nCommon Ancestry: All organisms on Earth share a common ancestor.\nNatural Selection: The non-random process where certain traits increase an organism’s chances of survival and reproduction.\nNon-selective mechanisms: Evolution is also influenced by random factors, such as genetic drift or mutations.",

    "section": "2.6 The Post-Darwin Era",
    "text": "2.6 The Post-Darwin Era\nWhen On The Origin Of Species was published in 1859, it was an immediate best seller. The first edition quickly sold out, with numerous additional editions being issued over the years. Theologins were appalled and a majority of the established natural scientists were skeptical, while many of the younger scientists like Thomas Henry Huxley (1825–1895), and Joseph Dalton Hooker (1817–1911) became ardent supporters. Over time the concept of evolution through descent with modification generally gained widespread acceptance by the 1870s. However, Darwin’s proposed mechanism of natural selection as the primary driver of evolution remained contentious for about six decades following Darwin’s publication.\nThe aftermath of Darwin’s groundbreaking work fostered in a period of significant scientific advancement and debate in evolutionary biology. The late 19th and early 20th centuries marked a golden age for paleontology and comparative studies in morphology and embryology. This period saw extensive research into the fossil record and organismal relationships, with Darwin’s idea of descent with modification taking an increasingly important role as the bedrock of understanding natural patterns.\n\nAlternative Theories\nThere were several alternative theories to Darwin’s that emerged during this time. Principal among them were:\n\nNeo-Lamarckism: These theories revived the idea of inherited acquired characteristics. However, experiments like August Weismann’s tail-cutting study on mice failed to support this concept.\nOrthogenesis: Proponents of this theory believed in “straight-line evolution,” suggesting that species evolved in predetermined directions due to internal forces, independent of natural selection. Once along one of these predetermined directions, which may well have been adaptive at the start, a species would continue along that trend with a sort of momentum, eventually progressing to nonadaptive extremes. This all suggested a sort of directionalty and purpose to nature, revisiting outdated concepts steeped in teleology.\nMutationism: Some geneticists proposed that new species arose solely through mutations, without the need for natural selection. For example, in single generation a new mutation could produce a new species, a concept effectively promoted by the Dutch plant physiologist Hugo de Vries (1848–1934). This idea continued up until the 1930s when Richard Goldschmidt coined the phrase “hopeful monsters”. Though mutationism saw some support among the increasing number of scientists studying evolution at the time, there was little empirical support, and ultimately considered erroneous.\n\n\n\nThe Evolutionary Synthesis\nOne of the biggest stumbling blocks in the acceptance of Darwin’s theories was a lack of understanding of basic inheritance. The generally accepted view of inheritance at the time, and this included Darwin, was of “blending inheritance”, which posed a substantial problem to how natural selection could work. However, this all starting changing in the early 1900s with the rediscovery of Mendel’s work and a increasing interest in genetics research. Still it took roughly two decades for the field of genetics to unify around Mendel’s theory, mostly due to a new generation of investigators trained in mathematics and statistics, and apply this new understanding directly to Darwinism.\nThe stage was then set in the 1930s and 1940s for a reconciliation between Darwin’s ideas and this newly emerging understanding of genetic principles. This framework, often called neo-Darwinism, the Evolutionary Synthesis, or the Modern Synthesis, rested on the concept that adaptive evolution results from natural selection acting on Mendelian genetic variation. Though not one single event per se, the Evolutionary Synthesis (ES) saw the unification of ideas in the fields of Mendelian and quantitative genetics, mathematical population genetics, biometry, and evolutionary theory that included paleontology, taxonomy, biogeography, field studies of natural variation, and population structure. Key contributors to this synthesis included:\n\nMathematicians like Ronald A. Fisher, John B. S. Haldane, and Sewall Wright, who developed population genetics theories.\nBiologists such as Theodosius Dobzhansky, Ernst Mayr, and G. Ledyard Stebbins, who applied these concepts to various biological disciplines.\nPaleontologist George Gaylord Simpson, who integrated fossil evidence with the new evolutionary framework.\n\nThese scientists argued that microevolution (changes within species) and macroevolution (changes above the species level) are driven by the same fundamental processes: mutation, gene flow, natural selection, and genetic drift. This unified view forms the foundation of modern evolutionary biology, providing a comprehensive explanation for the diversity and adaptation of life on Earth, and establishing principles that continue to shape our understanding of evolution today.\nThis idea of a unified ES continued through the 1950s and onward, in particular driven and modified by insights from the emerging field of molecular biology marked by the seminal publication of Watson and Crick on the structure of DNA.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFundamental principles of evolution that emerged from the Evolutionary Synthesis (from Futuyma & Kirkpatric (2017))\n\n\n\n\nAn individual’s phenotype (its observed traits) is distinct from its genotype (its DNA). Phenotypic differences among individuals are caused by both genetic differences and environmental effects.\nAcquired characteristics are not inherited.\nHereditary variations are based on particles—the genes. This is true for traits with continuous variation(e.g., body size) as well as those with discrete variation(e.g., eye color)\nGenetic variation arises by random mutation. Mutations do not arise in response to need. Variation that arises by mutation is amplified by recombination of alleles at different loci.\nEvolution is a change of a population, not of an individual. The elementary process of evolution is a change across generations in the frequencies of alleles or genotypes, which can change the frequencies of phenotypes.\nChanges in allele frequencies may be random or nonrandom. Natural selection results from differences among individuals in survival and reproduction, and causes nonrandom changes. Genetic drift causes random changes.\nNatural selection can account for both slight and great differences among species. Even a low intensity of natural selection can cause substantial evolutionary change over time. Adaptations are traits that have been shaped by natural selection\nNatural selection can alter populations beyond the original range of variation when changes in allele frequencies generate new combinations of genes.\nPopulations usually have considerable genetic variation. Many populations evolve rapidly, to some degree, when environmental conditions change, and do not have to wait for new favorable mutations.\nThe differences between species evolve by rather small steps, and are often based on differences at many genes that accumulated over many generations.\nSpecies are groups of interbreeding or potentially interbreeding individuals that do not exchange genes with other such groups. Species are not defined simply by phenotypic differences. Rather, they represent separately evolving “gene pools”.\nSpeciation (the origin of two species from a single ancestor species) usually occurs by the genetic differentiation of geographically isolated populations. Species have genetic differences that prevent interbreeding if they are no longer geographically separated.\nHigher taxa arise by the sequential accumulation of small differences, rather than by the sudden appearance of drastically new types by mutation.\nAll organisms form a great Tree of Life (or phylogeny) that evolved by the branching of common ancestors into diverse lineages, chiefly by speciation.\nAll forms of life descended from a single common ancestor that lived in the remote past.\n\n\n\n\n\nBeyond the Evolutionary Synthesis\nThe rapid development of molecular biology marked by Watson and Crick’s model of DNA published in 1953 saw evolutionary biology making great strides in understanding in various areas, e.g. ability or estimate evolutionary rates, the molecular basis of evolution, molecular taxonomy and phylogenetics, genome structure and function, comparative genomics of related lineages, the complexities around the genotype-phenotype connection, and mechanisms driving variation across the genome. Some important highlights of this period included:\n\nCrick’s outlining of what is now referred to as the Central Dogma of Molecular Biology and the prediction of using protein sequence data to potentially date evolutionary events (Cobb (2017)).\nZuckerkandl and Pauling (1962) formally introduced the concept of the molecular clock (though not yet by that name).\nW. D. Hamilton published two papers on “The Genetical Evolution of Social Behaviour” in 1964. These defined the concept of inclusive fitness and kin selection, providing a Darwinian interpretation for seemingly nonadaptive behaviors such as altruistism.\nGeorge C. Williams publishes his influential book Adaptation and Natural Selection (1966), which ushered the movement in the field toward a gene centered view of natural selection and away from growing naive views of group selection that were becoming prevalent at that time.\nPublication of Lewontin and Hubby’s seminal paper on protein variation in natural populations (Charlesworth et al. (2016)), a landmark in the study of genome-wide levels of variability using protein electrophoresis. This and other papers at that time led to decade’s of research on many different species by numerous investigators using allozymes. It marked the beginning of a revolution in the field of evolutionary biology, and advances in understanding of important population genetics processes such as genetic drift, balancing and purifying selection, and the effects of selection on linked variants. The current use of whole-genome sequences in studies of variation is the direct descendant of this pioneering work.\nIn response to Lewontin and Hubby’s work, Motoo Kimura introduced the neutral theory of molecular evolution in 1968, which led to a decade’s long debate concerning the selective nature of allozyme variation referred to as the neutralist-selectionist debate, emphasizing the importance of neutral molecular variation (later nearly-neutral by Ohta) and genetic drift in driving patterns of genetic variation within and among individuals and populations.\nThe English translation of Willi Hennig’s influential book on cladistics, titled “Phylogenetic Systematics,” is published in 1966. This work laid the foundation for what would become known as cladistics, transforming the classification of organisms into a more rigorous science. It also marked a decade’s long debate between cladists (those who evangelized Hennig’s approach to systematics and phylogenetics) and the pheneticists (researchers who promoted the methods of numerical taxonom and phenetics.\nEldredge and Gould published their landmark paper on punctuated equilibrium in 1972 proposing that the degree of gradualism commonly attributed to Darwin is virtually nonexistent in the fossil record, and that stasis dominates the history of most fossil species, punctuated by bouts of rapid evolution. Their marked yet another decade’s long controversy on whether evolution occurred by phyletic gradualism or punctuated equilibrium.\nIn 1975, E. O. Wilson published his controversial book Sociobiology: The New Synthesis, where he attempted to apply evolutionary principles to animal and human social behavior. This of course provoked intense debate and withering criticism, including a reliance on genetic determinism, a lack of empirical evidence, dependence on the Naturalistic Fallacy, and numerous political implications. More recently sociobiology (and its reliance on group selection thinking) has seen an emergence with the advent of evolutionary psychology in the 1990s, reigniting debates about the extent to which human behavior and cognition can be explained by evolutionary adaptations.\nEdward B. Lewis (1978) published a paper describing homeotic genes, showing that many so-called toolkit genes act to regulate development, influencing the expression of other genes. His paper marks the beginning of Evolutionary Developmental Biology or EvoDevo as an important field in evolutionary biology.\nStarting in the 1980s, rapid advances in molecular biology quickly spilled over into evolutionary biology including cloning, DNA RFLP analysis, mitochondrial DNA analysis, Sanger sequencing, PCR, automated sequencing, transcriptome analysis, and on up to whole genome/transcriptome analyses today has led to profound insights into how evolution works and the genotype-phenotye connection so critical in understanding how evolution really works.\n\nWhile there have been advances, such as insights from evolutionary developmental biology (evodevo), the core framework established by the Modern Synthesis remains central to evolutionary biology. With the opening of the molecular age marked by the seminal work of Watson and Crick and our increased though unfinished understanding of the genome-phenotype connection driven by modern molecular biology and genomics, there have been calls to revisit and refine the Evolutionary Synthesis ranging from modifying the central tenets on up to “Darwin was all wrong and we need to completely revise the failed ES”. In the next section we will very briefly mention a few of these criticisms and suggestions before wrapping up this section.",

    "section": "The Extended Evolutionary Synthesis (ESS)",
    "text": "The Extended Evolutionary Synthesis (ESS)\nSince the late 1990’s and early 2000’s there has been repeated calls to modify or extend the Evolutionary Synthesis to accommodate recent advances and findings in such diverse fields as the study of society, developmental biology, epigenetics, molecular biology, microbiology, genomics, symbiogenesis, and horizontal gene transfer. Some authors have gone to such extremes as to declare that the ES is not just incomplete, but has been effectively falsified by later biological research (Noble (2011)), or that the “the edifice of the [early 20th century] Modern Synthesis has crumbled, apparently, beyond repair” (Koonin (2009)). As you can probably imagine, I am not a fan of these positions. I see neither of these author’s arguments as warranting a rejection of the ES in the least, nor as arguments against Darwin’s Theory of Evolution.\nStill, there remains a rising tide arguing for extending the ES to incorporate specifically some of the more recent insights. For example, Massimo Pigliucci has called for an Extended Evolutionary Synthesis that incorporates aspects of biology that had not been included or were not even known in the mid-20th century. His vision revisits the relative importance of different factors, challenges assumptions made in the modern synthesis, and adds a few new factors such as multilevel selection, transgenerational epigenetic inheritance, niche construction, and aspects of the concept of evolvability. Other authors point out that a new synthesis should embrace insights from other fields that were left out of the ES, including embryological developmental theory, morphology, and ecology, and should include concepts of inheritance that go beyond simple inheritance, for example epigenic effects1, phenotypic plasticity2, the Baldwin effect3 and maternal effects (Kutschera and Niklas (2004)). Many other authors have stated the importance of incorporating concepts of EvoDev theory into a new ESS, most notably Carroll (2008).\nIn my opinion, there is nothing particularly sacrosanct about the Evolutionary (Modern) Synthesis that requires that we hold it as dogma. It certainly does not deserve to thrown out completely as some authors declare, especially without having a clearly thought out and coherent replacement. Phenomena like horizontal gene transfer (HGT) are not a fatal challenge to evolution, but actually fit neatly to evolutionary theory as an additional source of genomic variation, something the original authors of the ES could not have possibly known about to take into consideration. Likewise HGT does nothing to cause us to throw out the whole concept of an evolutionary tree central to Darwin’s theory, though there are authors that claim that is the case. It is after all simply a metaphor for common descent that lends itself quite readily to estimating using math and algorithms. It may not be the greatest metaphor for Bacteria and Archae evolution (it certainly seems pretty solid by me for Eukaryotes), but please give us a better one to work with besides clouds of data points.\nIn fact, The Evolutionary (or Modern) Synthesis is probably best viewed more as a bookmark in the history of evolutionary thinking rather than a specific event that codified evolutionary theory to perpetuity. It is an ongoing endeavor, seamlessly changing as it incorporates new scientific discoveries and insights, yet retaining most of the original structure that marked the original edifice.\nIn closing, I suppose I am in agreement (no surprise there) with my PhD advisor Doug Futuyma when he states “Evolutionary theory will continue to be extended, but there is no sign that it requires emendation.” (Futuyma (2017)). In other words, sure these new findings provide exciting new insights into how evolution works and should be taken into consideration in the ongoing project that is the Evolutionary Synthesis, but none of this requires such a major change of how we understand evolution to work as to require a major upheaval of the Evolutionary Synthesis. Or at least I think that is what Doug is saying.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExciting times indeed\n\n\n\nIn fact, it is a pretty exciting time in the field of evolutionary biology. Continued advances in genomics, our understanding of the genome-phenome connection, and the increasing application of evolutionary theory in the various fields that make up the biosciences, makes for some increasing breath taking leaps foward in understanding us and the world we find ourselves. Take a look at the following opinion published in Nature Ecology and Evolution in April 2024, and I think you might agree: “Exciting Times for Evolutionary Biology” (2024).",

    "text": "2.7 Some Key Concepts In Evolutionary Biology To Keep In Mind\nSome important aspects of evolution to keep in mind as we begin our exploration of the topic that I have found students tend to not appreciate:\n\nPopulations Evolve, Not Individuals: As mentioned above, evolution refers to changes in the genetic composition of populations over time. Individual organisms do not evolve, they develop and/or acclimate. Instead, populations evolve through the gradual accumulation of heritable changes.\nEvolution does not cause variation to occur in a population. Mutation loosely defined (and recombination in sexualy reproducing organisms) gives rise to variation. Rather evolution acts to change the frequency of preexisting variation (mutations) in a population. This is particularly important to appreciate when we discuss natural selection and how it really works.\nNatural Selection and Adaptation: Natural selection drives adaptation, resulting in improvements in the function of traits within populations. While many processes can cause evolutionary change, only natural selection leads to adaptations.\nStochastic Processes in Evolution: Evolution is not always predictable. Many evolutionary changes are driven by random processes, such as mutations or environmental events (e.g. think asteroids and dinosaurs).\nHistorical Contingency: Evolution is also shaped by historical events that have set certain species on unique evolutionary paths. Some traits are retained not because they are optimal, but because they were present in ancestral species.\nConstraints on Evolution: Where evolution can go isprofoundly limited by genetic, developmental, chemical, and physical constraints. These constraints influence the rate and direction of evolutionary changes.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nExplore More: Misconceptions about Evolution\nDespite the broad scientific consensus on the importance of evolutionary theory in understanding the diversity of life, people hold many misconceptions about evolutionary theory and processes, its implications, and its relation to religious beliefs. I encourage you to explore the fantastic resource provided by The University of California Museum of Paleontology, which lists common misconceptions about evolution and clarifies these misconceptions.",

    "text": "3.1 An introduction to the evidence\nWhen Darwin’s ideas of evolution and natural selection were first proposed, they were indeed an hypothesis. Now they are considered “facts”, but there was a time when like any good scientific hypothesis, they required testing through the development of testable predictions that can be falsified with hard empirical data. Generally speaking, if we consider Darwin’s idea of descent with modification as a reasonable description (if not a definition) of evolution, then we find that there are five predictions that can be tested through experimentation and hard data:\nThough there may be numerous other predictions that come from Darwin’s hypothesis of common descent, the above list makes for a good starting point for organizing our discussions, a road map so to speak to summarize the evidence demonstrating evolution as the explanation for the diversification of life on earth.\nBut before we do this, we need to discuss a very important distinction of types of evidence, and that is a prediction versus a retrodiction.\nBefore continuing with the evidence, I would like to point you to an excellent book by Jerry Coyne, one of the leading figures in modern evolutionary biology, entitled “Why Evolution Is True”. It is definitely worth the read. The only reason I do not assign it for my course is that we simply do not have the time to go over his book in the detail it deserves and get to the rest of what we need to discuss in one semester. Give it a look though.\nThis being our modern world, there are also a number of YouTube videos where Dr. Coyne presents his take on the evidence for evolution. The following is only one of many, but deserves a careful listen (HINT: start the video at the 3:35 mark, and feel free to stop it at the 51:05 mark, where he transitions into religion and evolution).",

This is fundamentally consistent with what we consider to be a prediction in say a basic laboratory experiment, e.g. in chemistry if I mix chemical A with B the outcome will be C. In biology things get little more complicated, actually alot more complicated (which is what makes biolgy so interesting in my opinion), and can not always be tested in a laboratory setting. Nonetheless, we can use observations in nature to test predictions. For example, if common ancestry is correct, then we should find that species that have split more recently from each other should be more genetically similar to each other than they are to species that they are more distantly related to. So for example, we should find that humans and chimpanzees tend to be more genetically similar to each other than either are to say whales. A simple straightforward prediction derived from common ancestry.\n\n\n• Retrodiction - This is strange sounding term that basically says that the observation may not necessarily be directly predicted by evolution, but that explaining the observed patterns make most sense in light of evolution. Some examples we will see below will be more retrodictions than based on predictions, for example biogeographic distributions, developmental patterns (comparative development), and vestigial structures, but nonetheless provide compelling evidence for evolution.",

    "section": "3.3 Microevolution",
    "text": "3.3 Microevolution\nMicroevolution is the change in inherited traits of a population from one generation to the next, ultimately leading to the accumulation of changes and the transformation of species through time. Heritable trait in this context can refer to any phenotypic trait (for example the average beak size in a population of a bird) or a molecular trait (e.g. the frequency of alternative alleles at a particular locus) or genomic variant (e.g. a copy number variant or an inversion polymorphism). While changes in most traits from one generation to the next are subtle at best, strong natural selection can lead to significant and detectable evolutionary changes in very short periods of time.\nOne way to think about microevolution is “observing change over time of a heritable trait”. This is effectively the definition of evolution, so any examples of observed change over time is by definition observing evolution.\nA convenient way of discussing the various evidence out there (and there is a near infinite number of them) is to sort them into categories such as the following:\n\nNatural Populations\nObserving changes in natural populations directly or at least over historical time is powerful evidence for evolution: it is anagenesis in action. Over the decades there has been an incredible number of examples of populations changing over time published, and the number continues to increase every year. There are simply too many to cover in any detail here, so below is a very short list of some of the classic examples:\n\nindustrial melanism in the peppered moth Biston betularia (Cook and Saccheri (2012)); recent studies has demonstrated the genetic basis of the melanic form (Hof et al. (2016); more recently Tian et al. (2024))\nthe soapberry bug in Florida, which has shown changes in beak size over approximately 100 years, in response to changes in its preferred fruit size (Carroll et al. (2005)).\nthe evolution of house sparrows in North America, which have exhibited changes in size and color over roughly 100 generations (Johnston and Selander (1964)).\nnatural populations of the three spine stickleback Gasterosteus aculeatus. (see below)\n\nHuman-Driven Change: Resistance to drugs, insecticides, and herbicides offers a clear example of evolution in action. HIV’s resistance to treatments like AZT, and the shrinking size of fish due to commercial fishing pressures, are notable examples, as are changes that occur in invasive species when they colonize a new environment (Palumbi (2001)).\nChange in the fossil record: Though much of the evidence for observed change over time comes from extant populations or populations that we can at least follow and observe over historical time, we also see these types of observed changes in the fossil record. Collecting this kind of data can be very work intensive, yet we still have a number of excellent examples. One of my favorites is an outstanding study on changes in a fossil assemblage of the sticklebacks from Bell and colleagues (Bell (2009)).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFig A is a an example of a fossil stickleback. Fig B shows the change in the mean pelvic phenotype over time.\n\n\n\n\n\nArtificial selection\nArtificial selection is effectively the same as natural selection only we become the selecting agent. We decide who gets to survive and reproduce, with potentially profound impacts on the diversity of these organisms. What are talking about here is our impact on the evolution of our domestic crops, livestock, and pets, for which there are a vast array of examples in the literature.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImages from Understanding Evolution.\n\n\n\nIn fact, artificial selection (in particular breeds of dogs and pigeons) profoundly impacted Darwin’s thinking, using artificial selection as an analogy to natural selection and the extensive variation that existed in populations. In some cases artificial selection acting over generations can result in reproductive isolation, which can be the precursor to the formation of new species.\n\n\nExperimental Populations\nExperiments like Richard Lenski’s Long-Term Evolution Experiment (LTEE) with E. coli (Discover website) and laboratory studies with Drosophila (e.g. Burke and Rose (2009)), plus numerous others, have clearly demonstrated that we can demonstrate and study evolution in the laboratory with controlled studies.\nFor a particulary compelling visual example of experimental evolution in a labortory population of E. coli, check out the following video produced by the Kishony Lab at Harvard Medical School. They have designed a simple way to observe how bacteria evolve as they encounter increasingly higher doses of an antibiotic and adapt to survive—and thrive—despite of it.\n\nYou might say that bacteria are different. After all, assuming a generation time of 30 minutes, the two-week experiment described in the video represents over 670 generations of bacterial evolution. Translated to humans, that would represent about 17,000 years. Looking back that far in history, that was a time when humans exclusively lived as hunter-gatherers and just started to migrate into North America over the Bering Land Bridge…\n\n\nA case study: rapid change and sticklebacks\nOne of the most persistent misconceptions about evolution is that it takes millions of years to occur. However, the reality is that microevolution—in principle—can happen in as little as one generation. Those short-term changes can be very hard to detect, because our measurement error of a trait of interest is often larger than the actual per-generation evolutionary change. Nonetheless, over the course of just a handful of generations, natural populations may exhibit significant evolutionary change that we can detect with high confidence using genetic markers (i.e., measuring changes in allele frequencies) or phenotypic measurements.\nThe convergence of ecological and evolutionary timescales is a relatively recent insight. Darwin did not think that we would be able to directly observe evolutionary change over short periods of time:\n\n“We see nothing of these slow changes in progress, until the hand of time has marked the lapse of ages.”\n— Darwin, 1859\n\nHowever, with technological breakthroughs that improved the precision of measurements we take in natural populations and with scientists’ ability to track populations continuously through time, we have accumulated data across dozens of study systems—from microbes to vertebrates—documenting microevolutionary change within a few to a few dozen generations (see Hairston et al. (2005); CARROLL et al. (2007)). Here, Professor Tobler will briefly introduce you to evidence for rapid evolution gathered in one such study system (the threespine stickleback). In this chapter’s case study, you will explore another example based on a time series of beak size variation of a species of Darwin’s finch.\n\nThe Case of Threespine Stickleback\nThreespine stickleback (Gasterosteus aculeatus; Figure 3.1)) are a widely used system to study evolution and have been shown to rapidly adapt to novel environmental conditions. Stickleback are primarily marine and inhabit coastal waters throughout much of the Northern hemisphere. They are small fish (usually less than 8 cm in length) that exhibit exquisite adaptations to avoid predation in their environment: the sides of their body are covered in bony plates, and they have spines associated with their dorsal and pelvic fins that, when spread out, can dissuade a predator from capturing or consuming them.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3.1: Threespine stickleback (Gasterosteus aculeatus). Photo by Gilles San Martin, CC BY-SA 2.0, via Wikimedia Commons.\n\n\n\nSince the last ice age, as glaciers retreated and left behind a plethora of new streams and lakes, stickleback have also colonized freshwater habitats, which differ in many ways from the original marine habitats. Freshwaters not only exhibit a different water chemistry, but they also tend to harbor fewer predators and different food resources. Over the past 10,000-20,000 years, stickleback in freshwater environments have evolved a number of phenotypic differences compared to their marine ancestors, including a drastic reduction of the armor plates along the body and—in some instances—a loss of the pelvic spines (Jones et al. 2012). Moreover, stickleback have also adapted to different niches within freshwaters, and there are distinct morphs in streams and lakes, and in benthic and pelagic habitats within lakes (Hendry et al. 2013). Different freshwater ecotypes exhibit distinct body shapes and colorations and are adapted to consuming different types of prey items.\nSo, how long might it take for the evolution of the traits that vary so drastically across different stickleback forms? Sure, 20,000 years is a blink of an eye in the history of life on the planet, but it is still an eternity for any researcher that might want to observe evolution in action.\nOne hint at how fast stickleback might evolve comes from a fascinating natural experiment. In 1964, the Great Alaska Earthquake brought widespread destruction to the region and literally reshaped the regional topology. For example, multiple islands in the Prince William Sound and the Gulf of Alaska were lifted up further out of the ocean, creating new freshwater ponds where previously were none. In the time since the earthquake, stickleback have colonized these new freshwater ponds, and within just 50 years, they have evolved similar phenotypic traits that we know from stickleback in continental freshwaters (Lescak et al. 2015). Hence, adaptation to freshwaters upon colonization from the ocean may occur in a matter of a few decades rather than gradually over thousands of years of evolution.\nTo get a better understanding of just how fast evolution may proceed, researchers from the University of Basel in Switzerland decided to conduct a field experiment using lake and stream stickleback (Laurentino et al. 2020). The researchers first sequenced the genomes of lake and stream stickleback to detect the genomic regions that are differentiated between ecotypes and likely contain the genes involved in shaping the phenotypic differences between them. After that, they generated F2 crosses between the ecotypes, which is like shuffling a deck of cards from a genomic perspective: individual F2 offspring essentially exhibit a random mixture of genomic segments from their lake and stream ancestors. If these F2 hybrids were introduced into a stream environment, it is predicted that individuals that exhibit stream alleles in regions of the genome important for the expression of stream-specific phenotypic traits perform better than individuals with lake alleles. At a population level, this should lead to an increase in the frequency of alleles characteristic for stream stickleback. And, this is exactly what happened when the researchers actually conducted the experiment. More importantly, the predicted genetic changes were detectable within just one generation of F2 individuals being released into a stream habitat. So, when selection is strong and researchers have the capability to measure changes in traits with adequate precision, we can actually detect the small, generation-to-generation changes that ultimately accumulate to give rise to more conspicuous evolutionary changes that are easier to detect.",

    "section": "3.4 Speciation",
    "text": "3.4 Speciation\nSpeciation is the process by which new species arise. Before we dive into how speciation actually works, we should agree on what species actually are:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nDefinition: Species\nA biological species is a group of organisms that can reproduce with one another in nature and produce fertile offspring. Species are characterized by the fact that they are reproductively isolated from other such groups, which means that the organisms in one species are incapable of reproducing with organisms in another species. (As you may know, there are alternative definitions of a species, which we will discuss in more detail in Chapter 11.)\n\n\nIn phylogenetic trees, speciation is depicted as a singular point that represents the moment one lineage splits into two (red circle in Figure 3.2. Although speciation can occur instantaneously, for example when polyploidization is involved (see Chapter 11), new species typically evolve gradually, from a single variable population, to populations within a species that are differentiated but still connected through gene flow, to distinct species that are completely isolated from each other (Figure 3.2). Movement along this “speciation continuum” is driven by the accumulation of reproductive barriers that prevent individuals from mating or successfully producing offspring with each other. Importantly, movement along the speciation continuum can be bidirectional, and reproductive barriers can disappear such that two species merge back together into one. If speciation is a gradual process, we should be able to observe all stages along the speciation continuum in nature, not just the endpoints of the speciation process with reproductively isolated species.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3.2: Speciation is not typically an instantaneous process. Rather species evolve gradually along a speciation continuum.\n\n\n\n\nRing Species\nOne phenomenon that perfectly illustrates the speciation continuum and provides evidence for ongoing speciation are so-called ring species, in which two reproductively isolated populations living sympatrically (red and brown in Figure 3.3 are connected by a geographic ring of populations that can interbreed. Such ring species arise when an original population disperses around a geographic barrier, and populations diverge gradually, for example as a consequence of adaptation to local environmental conditions. Once populations come into sympatry again behind the geographic barrier, sufficient differences have accumulated such that populations cannot interbreed with each other anymore.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3.3: A schematic representing a ring species. Individuals are able to successfully reproduce with members of adjacent populations, as indicated by the black arrows. However, as populations disperse around a geographic barrier and diverge gradually, they are unable to reproduce when they come into contact again. This process represents a form of speciation occurring with gene flow.\n\n\n\nSeveral well-studied examples of ring species exist. For example, plethodontid salamanders of the Ensatina eschscholtzii complex have colonized different parts of California from the north and expanded southward around the Central Valley, which represents unsuitable habitat for salamanders. At the southern tip of the Central valley, salamander populations from the eastern and western mountain ridges that surround the valley came into secondary contact and are unable to interbreed due to the genetic changes that have accumulated during evolution in isolation (Pereira et al. 2011). Other examples of ring species include the herring and lesser black-backed gulls (genus Larus) that have a circumpolar distribution and cannot interbreed in northern Europe. In addition, greenish warblers (Phylloscopus trochiloides) form a ring species around the Himalayas (Irwin et al. 2005).\n\n\nCatching Speciation in Action\nEvidence for ongoing speciation also comes from a wide variety of study systems that do not occur in a ring. Especially when populations are subject to strong natural selection (for example if they inhabit different habitat types), we do not only observe adaptive differentiation across populations but also the inadvertent emergence of reproductive isolation. As populations acquire traits that make them better suited to the environments they inhabit, individuals also tend to stop interbreeding with individuals from different populations that have different traits. This is called ecological speciation, and we explore this concept in more detail in Chapter 11. As a consequence, we can often find populations along various stages of the speciation continuum.\nTimema stick insects are a great example. These insects are distributed in the western United States, and different species of Timema have adapted to live and feed on different host plants. While most species are uniformly green, gray, or brown and live on broad-leaved host plants, several species have independently evolved a dorsal stripe that provides camouflage on needle-like leaves, providing protection from predators Figure 3.4. In at least one species, T. cristinae, both uniformly colored and striped populations exist depending on whether they live on host plants with broad or needle-like leaves. While these phenotypic differences within T. cristinae parallel differences between other Timema species, reproductive isolation between different T. cristinae populations utilizing alternative host plants is still incomplete (Nosil 2007). Hence, the different ecotypes represent intermediate stages of speciation. Similar variation along the speciation continuum has been uncovered in a wide variety of other natural study systems, and we will get to know some of them in more detail later in the book.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3.4: Timema stick insects have adapted to different host plants. Left: T. cristinae on one of its hosts, Greenbark (Ceanothus spinosus). Photo by Aaron C, public domain. Right: T. poppensis on its host, Redwood (Sequoia sempervirens). Photo by Moritz Muschick, CC BY 2.0.\n\n\n\nA more recent and very impressive study on the order Phasmatodea, which includes stick and leaf insects (Boisseau, Bradler, and Emlen (2024)), has demonstrated that similar environmental conditions experienced by various species plus the time since divergence can predict the level of morphological convergence, demonstrating that evolution can be surprisingly predictable even when lineages have been evolving independently for tens of millions of years.",

    "section": "3.5 Macroevolution",
    "text": "3.5 Macroevolution\nWhen discussing evidence for microevolution and speciation, we primarily turned to evidence from observations of living forms and from experiments. Here, we will consider a different type of evidence, fossils, which are simply the remains of prehistoric organisms. Fossils are usually petrified or preserved as a mold in rock, although the rapid thawing of permafrost accelerated by climate change has also revealed frozen fossils with amazing preservation of soft tissues (for example, check out this story about the recent discovery of nun cho ga, a baby woolly mammoth). The mere fact that fossils exist and often represent forms that are distinct from any organisms alive today (Figure 3.5) is testament to the ever-changing faunas and floras that have inhabited Earth through time. The fossil record also teaches us that extinction is an important aspect of evolutionary change, just as the generation of novel forms.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nExplore More\nIf you are interested in learning more about what fossils teach us about evolution, I highly recommend Donald R. Prothero’s book “Evolution: What the Fossils Say and Why It Matters”.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3.5: A woolly mammoth (left) and an American mastodon (right) facing each other, showing the physical differences between the two extinct animals. Illustration by Dantheman9758, CC BY-SA 3.0.\n\n\n\n\nGeographic and Temporal Patterns of Succession\nPerhaps the strongest evidence fossils provide for Darwin’s notion of evolution is that they are not randomly distributed, neither in terms of geography nor time. The constant cycle of descent with modification and extinction has created predictable patterns in fossil deposits across the planet, which is evident as a succession of novel forms that are derived from earlier ones.\nPatterns of succession are evident geographically, because there tends to be a regional correspondence between fossils and living forms. That is, we tend to find fossil relatives of extant species in the same areas where extant species live today. For example, marsupial fossils are particularly common in Australia just like living marsupials today. This is also reflected in the biogeographic distribution of extant forms, which frequently tracks the changing landmasses driven by continental drift. Marsupials are not only found in Australia but also South America, which were once connected through Antarctica in a large landmass called Gondwana until about 140 million years ago. The non-random distribution of fossils means that we can develop hypotheses and test predictions about the fossil record. For example, if the biogeographic distribution of marsupials was the consequence of a once contiguous distribution on Gondwana, we would predict the presence of marsupial fossils on Antarctica, which have indeed been found (Woodburne & Zinsmeister 1982).\nPatterns of succession are also evident temporally, with fossils exhibiting more ancestral traits being found in older layers of rock compared to derived forms. Subsequently deposited rock layers can therefore shed light into the temporal dynamics of trait evolution and reveal entire time series that connect forms with disparate phenotypes. For example, we know that horses with their single hoof descended from multi-toed ancestors, because we have a time series of horse fossils that illustrates the toe reductions through time (Figure 3.6).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3.6: Equine evolution, composed from skeletons of the State Museum for Natural History Karlsruhe, Germany. From left to right: Size development, biometrical changes in the cranium, reduction of toes on the left forefoot. Image by H. Zell, CC BY-SA 3.0, via Wikimedia Commons.\n\n\n\n\n\nTransitional Fossils\nIf novel forms are indeed descendants from earlier forms, the fossil record should capture evidence of what Darwin called the “transmutation of species”. Hence, we should be able to find transitional fossils that exhibit traits common to both an ancestral group and its derived descendants. The first, and perhaps still one of the most spectacular, transitional fossil ever found was Archaeopterix (Figure 3.7), which shared traits with Mesozoic dinosaurs and modern birds. Its jaws contained sharp teeth, and it has wings with fingers and claws, a long bony tail, hyperextensible second toes (like Velociraptor’s), and feathers. Hence, Archaeopterix represents a transitional fossil between modern birds and non-avian dinosaurs (Ostrom 1976). Similar transitional fossils have been discovered to link the transition from aquatic to terrestrial vertebrates (Tiktaalik Section 3.9), from marine mammals to their terrestrial ancestors (Pakicetus, Ambulocetus, and Remingtonocetus), and from quadrupedal to bipedal hominids (Australopithecus afarensis), among many others.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3.7\n\n\n\nAn extremely important aspect of transitional forms is where they are found in the fossil record. If evolution is correct, then transitional forms should always be found in geologic strata that dates between the ancestral and derived fossil species. If we were to find a transitional form that either predates the ancestral fossils or post-dates the derived fossil species, that would raise some serious questions about the nature of the transitional form.\nIt is not just the presence of transitional forms, but where in the fossil record they are found. To date, there has yet to be a single reported example in the literature where a transitional form is found inconsistent with our expectations. This is exceptionaly solid evidence for evolution.",

    "text": "3.6 Common Ancestry and Homology\nA key prediction of Darwin’s notion of evolution is that species are not independent but connected by descent from a common ancestor. Phylogenetic trees (Figure @ref(fig:ithink)) are representations of that connectedness, and if we were to travel back in time toward the root of the phylogenetic tree, we would expect lineages to merge into the origin of life, the original being from which all living forms descended (also known as the last universal common ancestor, or LUCA). In the absence of time travel, the critical evidence for common ancestry of all life is homology.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nDefinition: Homology\nHomology is the similarity of the structure, physiology, or development of different species based upon their descent from a common evolutionary ancestor.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe original phylogenetic trees Darwin used to illustrate common ancestry. Left: The Tree of Life image that appeared in Darwin’s On the Origin of Species by Natural Selection (1859). It was the book’s only illustration. Right: Charles Darwin’s original 1837 sketch, his first diagram of an evolutionary tree from his First Notebook on Transmutation of Species (1837). Illustrations by Charles Darwin, Public Domain.\n\n\n\n\nHomology explains why all forms of life share certain characteristics. All forms of life, from microbes to plants and animals, share the same molecular building blocks: lipids that form the boundaries of cells and organelles, nucleic acids that encode information, proteins that play both structural and catalytic roles, and glycans that serve structure, energy storage, and regulatory purposes (Marth 2008). Different life forms, even those separated by billions of years of evolution, share these building blocks because they inherited them from a common ancestor.\nHomologies also occur at a more narrow scope. For example, Darwin was puzzled by the structural similarity in the forelimbs of terrestrial vertebrates even though they serve entirely different functions (Figure 3.8):\n\nWhat could be more curious than that the hand of a man, formed for grasping, that of a mole for digging, the leg of a horse, the paddle of the porpoise, and the wing of a bat, should all be constructed on the same patterns, and should include the same bones, in the same relative position?\n— Darwin, 1859\n\nHow do these similarities in structure arise? Again, it is because all terrestrial vertebrates inherited this shared limb structure from their common ancestor. Rather than “inventing” different types of forelimbs for different purposes (grabbing, running, flying, swimming), evolution has gradually modified and repurposed existing forelimb structures for new functions.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3.8\n\n\n\nHomologies occur in nested sets. Closely related species exhibit a higher number of homologies, because they inherited those traits from a shared ancestor. More distantly related taxa exhibit differences in their traits, because they have been on independent evolutionary trajectories for prolonged periods of time. Accordingly, analyses of homologous structures are used to infer phylogenetic relationships among taxa. We group species that share a lot of homologous traits closely together on a phylogenetic tree, while those that share few are further apart (see Chapter 7 for more information).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\n Important Note\nNot all trait similarities are the consequence of homology. Analogy in biology describes similarity of function and superficial resemblance of structures that have different origins. For example, the wings of a fly, a moth, and a bird are analogous, because they evolved independently as adaptations to a common function (flying). Analogies are a consequence of convergent evolution, where unrelated lineages evolve similar traits, typically as adaptations to similar lifestyles or environmental conditions.\n\n\n\nShared Flaws\nPerhaps the most compelling evidence for common ancestry comes from homologous structures that serve no purpose at all. The origin of these structures cannot be explained by adaptive evolution, and the only reason that some organisms exhibit functionless structures is because they have inherited them from an ancestor. I want to briefly introduce two such cases, vestigial organs and pseudogenes.\n\n\nVestigial Organs\nVestigial organs are rudimentary traits that lost some or all of the ancestral functions of the structure. Classic examples of vestigial organs in humans are the appendix (vestigial caecum), the coccyx (vestigial tail), and some muscles connected to the ear, which allow for ear mobility in other primates. Structural vestigial organs in other animals include remnants of limbs that are still expressed in some whales, snakes, and flightless birds (Figure 3.9).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3.9: Vestigial limbs are common in tetrapods.

Photo by Judi Lapsley Miller, CC BY 4.0.\n\n\n\nOne of the most fascinating examples of vestigiality comes from Mexican cavefish (Astyanax mexicanus) that are eyeless and completely blind as adults (Figure @ref(fig:astyanax)). Cavefish actually start growing eyes during embryonic development, and the lack of eyes in adult fish is a consequence of the abortion of eye development within the first few days of the growing embryo. The eye in this case is a developmental (rather than a structural) vestigial organ that makes a transient appearance during certain embryonic stages. More importantly, cavefish actually possess all the genes required for the normal development of an eye. It turns out, eye abortion is initiated by signaling factors associated with the developing cavefish lens. Transplantation of a surface fish lens into a developing cavefish leads to the normal formation of an eye, just like transplantation of a cave fish lens into a surface fish embryo leads to eye abortion (Krishnan and Rohner 2017). If cavefish had originated independently, there would be no need for evolution to “create” the developmental machinery for eye development. Cavefish have that machinery because they lost eyes secondarily and inherited all the information for making an eye from their eyed surface ancestors.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3.10: Different forms of Astyanax mexicanus. Left: Cave form, which is completely blind and lacks body pigmentation as an adult. Right: An individual from a surface stream for comparison. Photos by Daniel Castranova, NICHD/NIH, Public Domain.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAtavisms\n\n\n\nRelated to vestigial organs, atavisms are the reappearance of an ancestral trait or characteristic in an organism after several generations of absence. This phenomenon occurs when genes for previously existing phenotypic features are preserved in DNA and become expressed through mutations or changes in gene regulation. Some examples include:\n\nWhales and dolphins with hind limbs: Some cetaceans have been found with vestigial hind limbs, reminiscent of their land-dwelling ancestors (e.g. HALL (1984)).\nChickens with teeth (this one is a little creepy): A mutation in chickens can lead to the development of cone-shaped crocodile-like teeth, reflecting their common ancestry with reptiles (Harris et al. (2006)).\nHumans with tails: Rarely, infants are born with vestigial tails, a trait present in our distant primate ancestors (Tomić and Meyer-Rochow (2011)).\nHorses with extra toes: Occasionally, horses are born with additional toes, resembling their multi-toed ancestors (Tyson et al. (2004)). Atavisms provide strong support for the theory of evolution for several reasons:\nGenetic preservation: They demonstrate that genetic information can be retained but not expressed for many generations, showing the continuity of genetic material through evolutionary time.\nCommon ancestry: Atavisms often reveal traits shared with ancestral species, supporting the idea of common descent.\nDevelopmental plasticity: They highlight the role of gene regulation in evolution, showing how changes in gene expression can lead to the reappearance of ancestral traits.\nEvolutionary history: Atavisms provide direct evidence of an organism’s evolutionary past, allowing researchers to trace the development of species over time.\nMolecular evidence: The study of atavisms has led to discoveries about the genetic mechanisms underlying evolutionary changes, such as the role of microRNAs in controlling trait expression.\n\nAtavisms are powerful evidence for evolution, more a retrodiction than prediction. Nonetheless. by revealing these “evolutionary throwbacks,” atavisms offer tangible evidence of the genetic and developmental links between modern species and their ancestors, thereby strengthening the case for evolutionary theory.\n\n\n\n\nMolecular and genomic evidence of shared ancestry\ntemp notes on other molecular evidence\nSome of the strongest evidence for evolution comes from molecular and genomics data, with much of it falling into the category of shared ancestry. In fact, if there were no other evidence for evolution from any of the other categories we have already mentioned or will mention, the evidence from the fields of molecular biology and genomics would alone prove evolution as the only explanation for the diversity of life. An entire field of research has emerged called molecular evolution, more recently rebranded as genomic evolution due to the staggering amount of DNA (and soon to be protein) data that we can now collect quickly, efficiently, cost effectively, and accurately. Molecular and genomic data is not only providing irrefutable evidence for evolution, it is also providing unique and exciting new insights into how evolution works.\nIn light of the above paragraph, what I am about to write should not come as a surprise; that the amount of evidence from molecular and genomic research is simply too vast to cover adequately, too overwhelming for this OER. I would point to advanced courses in the fields of molecular evolution and evolutionary genomics, and encourage you to explore the deep literature out there in the numerous scientific journals and books being published near daily, to really get a sense of the breath taking progress being made in these fast moving fields and the vast treasure trove of evidence coming from them. Nonetheless, it certainly is worth reviewing some of this evidence provided by molecular/genomic data, with the understanding that what we are about to discuss is but a small taste of what is in the literature. Later in this section we will discuss additional examples from molecular/genomics research that support other types of evidence. For now, we focus on those researches that fall under th category of common ancestry.\nThat being said, we will confine our discussion to the following:\n\nShared molecular mechanisms across all life\nUniversally shared features, such as: - DNA as the basis of inheritance all life - chemical form of amino acids: L-amino acids, never mirror image D-stereoisomers - a relatively highly conserved genetic code - basic machinery of life and their molecular components. For example the mechanisms making up the so called Central Dogma of Molecular Biology; transcription, translation, and replication and the molecules that drive these processes. - other less well known molecular mechanisms universally shared, for example the amino-acyl-tRNA synthases, the essential molecules that charge tRNAs with the appropriate amino acid, considered to be the third genetic code.\n\n\nOther fundamental conserved molecular mechanisms and biochemical/physiological pathways\nBiochemical, physiological, and developmental pathways that are shared across broad swaths of life. For example, a recently the conserved role of microRNA mir-193 in controlling melanic coloration in insects, demonstrates evolutionary continuity. Or the role of HOX gene clusters in driving development and morphological structures in complex Eukaryotes.\nOn a more fundamental level, the sharing of mitochondria adn their role in the production of ATP to drive cellular processes in just about all Eukaryotic lineages, or the sharing of chloroplasts in plants.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nHorizontal gene transfer: Recognition of horizontal gene transfer events has expanded our understanding of evolutionary processes beyond vertical inheritance[9]. Yet even then, we can follow patterns of inhertiance after HGT that are due to sharing a common ancestor.\n\n\n\n\nLevels of divergence\nThe ability to sequence and compare genomes across species has clearly demonstrated that levels of sequence divergence are exactly as expected from divergence from common ancestry. The more closely related two taxa are from each other (from an evolutionary perspective, i.e. sharing a more recent common ancestor), the more similar they are in terms of DNA sequence divergence. The further apart, the more divergent. We see this not just at the level of DNA and protein sequence divergence, but also at “higher” levels of genomic and chromosomal organization and structure.\n\n\nPseudogenes: molecular vestigial structures\nPseudogenes represent some of the strongest evidence out there for common ancestry. Just their very presence in genomes demands an evolutionary explanation, for how else could we reasonably explain their distribution among taxa and their persistance in most Eukaryotic genomes.\nPseudogenes are inactive copies of functional genes in the genome and represent another kind of evolutionary “flaw”. Pseudogenes can arise from two processes: (1) via a complex process generally referred to as gene duplication, which leads to what is referred to as classical pseudogene; (2) when processed messenger RNA (mRNA) is reverse-transcribed and inserted back into the genome, refrred to as a processed pseudogene. Reverse transcription is typically associated with retrotransposons or the activity of retroviruses in cells. Because processed mRNAs lack introns and other genetic elements important for transcription and translation, the complimentary DNA (cDNA) that is built back into the genome ends up being functionless. In the case of a classical pseudogene, once there is more than one copy of a gene in the genome, if the organism only requires one copy of the gene without an impact on the fitness, one of the copies can begin to accumulate mutations over time that can effectively knock the gene out for some reason. Hence, pseudogenes essentially represent junk DNA (though I really disike that term) invisible not only to the cellular machinery responsible for protein synthesis, but for natural selection as well.\nThe reason that pseudogenes are invisible for natural selection is that generally speaking they make no contribution to the phenotype of an organism, neither good or bad. While copy mistakes (i.e., mutations) that impair the function of normal genes are usually eliminated by selection, similar mutations in pseudogenes have no effect and just linger around. As generations pass, pseudogenes consequently tend to accumulate more and more mutations compared to the original functional gene they originated from. Since mutations in the genome occur at predictable rates, we can compare pseudogenes to their functional equivalents to estimate when pseudogenes first arose. Conducting such analyses for pseudogenes in the human genome revealed that some of them are really old—much older in fact than the human species. This suggests that those pseudogenes must have arisen in an ancient ancestor, which we share with other closely related species. If this is the case, we should be able to find the same pseudogenes in other primates, but only those that have diverged from a common ancestor after the origin of the pseudogene. (See the section on mapping characters on a phylogeny for further information on this logic.)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportant\n\n\n\nRecently there is increasing evidence that pseudogenes are actually not non-functional in the sense that they “do nothing”. Many pseudogeens are in fact transcribed, but no longer make functional mRNA for the original gene products they are derived from. It is not uncommon at all to find pseudogenes that code for various kinds of other functional RNAs, like miRNA, snoRNA, and lncRNAs, that serve important roles in regulating gene expression and other cellular processes. There is also some evidence that pseudogenes may impact gene expression levels. Nonetheless, this does not change the fact that there are clear patterns of pseudogenes shared among lineages due to the sharing of a common ancestor.\n\n\nFriedberg and Rhoads (2000) put this hypothesis to the test (Table 2.1). The oldest pseudogene they investigated (CALM II 𝛙3), which has an estimated age of about 36 million years (Myr) based on the mutational difference from the functional equivalent, is found in all five species of primates that they investigated (including divergence times between 8 and 36 Myr). In contrast, the youngest pseudogene (𝛂-Enolase 𝛙1; 11 Myr old) is only found in chimpanzees and gorillas, the only primates that have diverged from the human lineage less than 11 Myr ago. Overall, the pattern of the presence and absence of pseudogenes is consistent with common ancestry. There is no reason for species to evolve the same pseudogenes independently in a predictable pattern. Rather, species share these “flaws” simply because they were passed down from one generation to the next, even as lineages split and formed new species.\n\nTable 2.1: Pseudogenes that Friedberg and Rhoads (2000) detected in different primates (with hamsters as an outgroup). Individual pseudogenes identified in the human genome, along with their age estimates, are listed in rows. Different species with their estimated divergence times from humans are in columns. Symbols indicat the presence (+) or absence (-) of specific pseudogenes in a particular species.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChimpanzee\nGorilla\nOrangutan\nRhesus\nCapuchin\nHamster\n\n\n\n\n\n8 Myr\n9 Myr\n16 Myr\n25 Myr\n36 Myr\n&gt;85 Myr\n\n\n𝛂-Enolase 𝛙1\n11 Myr\n+\n+\n-\n-\n-\n-\n\n\nAS 𝛙7\n16 Myr\n+\n-\n+\n-\n-\n-\n\n\nCALM II 𝛙2\n19 Myr\n+\n+\n+\n-\n-\n-\n\n\nAS 𝛙1\n25 Myr\n+\n+\n+\n+\n-\n-\n\n\nAS 𝛙3\n25 Myr\n+\n+\n+\n+\n-\n-\n\n\nCALM II 𝛙3\n36 Myr\n+\n+\n+\n+\n+\n-\n\n\n\nThere are numerous other examples of pseudogenes in the literature, more than can be given justice here. However, a few of my favorites include:\n\nL-gulano-g-lactone oxidase gene (GLO), required for vitamin C synthesis (discussed in the Coyne video)\nolfactory receptors (OR), where something along the line of thousands of functional ORs are found in mice and dog genomes, but only around 400 functional ORs are found in humans, plus an additional 400 OR pseudogenes homologous with those found in mice or dogs. It is even more interesting in the Cetacea, dolphins and whales, where some 80% of ORs are pseudogenes (referenece needed).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3.11: The full OR repertoire of 58 mammalian genomes. The sequenced genomes of 58 ecologically and phylogenetically diverse mammals were mined for OR gene sequences. The number of functional ORs (yellow bars) and non-functional ORs (grey bars) in the full OR gene repertoire varies between different species. Species are ranked based on the size of their functional repertoire. The coverage of the genomes from which these data were mined, as noted in their assembly builds online, are also included with “C” representing “complete” for human and mouse. From Hughes et al. (2018).\n\n\n\n\nhemoglobin in Antarctic icefishes (e.g. O’Brien (2016) ).\n\n\n\nOther genomic regions demonstrating clear evidence of common descent\n\nsharing of classes of transposable elements and sharing insertion sites in the genome following the sharing of MRCA\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3.12: Distribution of various SINE retroelements among primate lineages. The image on the left shows the reults of PCR amplification for 5 different SINEs in human, chimp, bonobo, gorilla, orang-utan, siamang, green monkey, and owl monkey. In each gel image, the presence of a larger fragment signifies the presence of that particular SINE element in the genome. The image on the right shows the mapping of presence of the various SINEs along the primate phylogeny.\n\n\n\n\ndistribution and evolutionary pattern of members of gene families\n\nThese molecular and genomic findings collectively strengthen the evidence for common descent, natural selection, and the gradual accumulation of genetic changes over time, all key components of the Theory of Evolution.\n\n\n\nWhy Homologies Matter\nThe fact that evolutionary novelties occur in nested sets as predicted by descent with modification provides strong evidence for common ancestry. The finding also has far reaching implications, because it underlies all biomedical research and applications. The reason we can study DNA repair mechanisms in bacteria to learn about their role in cancer development is because DNA repair mechanisms in bacteria and humans are homologous. The reason we can study cell cycle regulation in yeast is because both yeast and humans inherited the same regulatory machinery from a common ancestor. The reason we can study drug responses in rodents is because the physiological processing of many substances is mediated by homologous pathways in rodents and humans. And we can gain insights about neurophysiology and psychiatry from other primates, again because we all inherited our neurosystem from a common ancestor. The reason evolution is the unifying theory of biology is because it provides the critical framework for comparative studies among species, helping us to make sure that we are actually comparing apples to apples (i.e., homologous structures). If not, inferences from comparative analyses can be deeply flawed.",

    "section": "3.7 Biogeography",
    "text": "3.7 Biogeography\nPatterns seen in the distribution of species both on a macro- (broad scale) and micro-level had been well recognized since before Darwin published OTOS. For example, the similarity and differences in species across continents such as marsupials in Australia while placental mammals dominated the rest of the world, or the deserts of Africa and of the Americas which harbor species that were superficially similar in form but showed other more fundamental diﬀerences, were well recognized. Even on smaller scales, for example the unique characteristic of island fauna and the relationship of island fauna to nearby continental or other island regions, were also increasingly being described. In both cases these patterns of species distributions were being descibed yet difficult to explain under the natural theistic explanations that dominated western science at the time.\nDarwin knew of these distribution patterns, He had observed some directly and read extensively about these and similar patterns, and thought long on what might explain these types of observations. His explanation, which took up two entire chapters in the OTOS (evidence of how important he thought it was), provided an evolutionary explanation of the geography of life. His original evolutionary explanation was largely correct when first proposed, and has only been refined and supported by a multitude of later studies. Since then molecular studies demonstrating the relationship of species both within and among regions has only further solidified the evidence of biogeographic patterns as evidence for evolution\n\n3.7.1 Continental scale\nSome examples of macrogeographic evidence are:\n\nSimilar ecosystems on different continents often harbor species that look the same. They occupy similar niches in the two continental systems, but clearly are very different in terms of sharing of a common ancestor. The most famous example of diﬀerent species filling similar roles involves is the marsupial mammals, now found mainly in Australia (the Virginia opossum Didelphis virginiana is a familiar exception), and placental mammals, which predominate elsewhere in the world (you probably discussed this extensively in your high school biology courses and in BIO114). The two groups show some important anatomical diﬀerences (most notably in their reproductive systems, where almost all marsupials have pouches and give birth to very undeveloped young, while placentals have placentas that enable young to be born at a more advanced stage) and represent two very different lineages that diverged approximately 160 million years ago (Ma) during the Jurassic period. Nevertheless, in other ways some marsupials and placentals are astonishingly similar looking. There are burrowing marsupial moles that look and act just like placental moles, marsupial mice that resemble placental mice, marsupial anteaters which do exactly what South American anteaters do, and a marsupial wolf Thylacinus cynocephalus, also known as the Tasmanian wolf or Tasmanian tiger, which is strikingly canine-like appearance and served the same ecological niche as mammalian wolves.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3.13: Examples of convergent evolution in marsupial and placental mammals as biogeographic evidence for evolution (@ MacMillen Press.\n\n\n\n\nDescent with modification predicts that organisms will be most similar in regions representing places of origin and subsequent dispersal. For example, descent with modification predicts that organisms in African tropics will be more similar to organisms in African deserts than to organisms in South American tropics because they are more likely to share a common ancestor. As discussed in Coyne (), we see this in many desert plants are succulents: they show an adaptive combination of traits that include large fleshy stems to store water, spines to deter predators, and small or missing leaves to reduce water loss. But diﬀerent deserts have diﬀerent types of succulents. In North and South America, the succulents are members of the cactus family. But in the deserts of Asia, Australia, and Africa, there are no native cacti, and the succulents belong to a completely diﬀerent family, the euphorbs. You can tell the diﬀerence between the two types of succulents by their flowers and their sap, which is clear and watery in cacti but milky and bitter in euphorbs. Yet despite these fundamental diﬀerences, cacti and euphorbs can look very much alike.\nAnother body of evidence can be found in the existence of similar, yet distinct, species inhabiting comparable environments across different continents. For instance, the red deer of Northern Europe and the North American elk share a striking resemblance. Similarly, the Pipidae family of tongueless aquatic frogs can be found in both South America and Africa. These distribution patterns would be perplexing if the continents had always been in their current positions. These animals would have no way to traverse the vast oceans.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRed deer; from https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_deer\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nElk; from https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elk\n\n\n\n\n\nHowever, the theory of continental drift clarifies this phenomenon. Ancient land bridges, such as the Bering Land Bridge connecting Asia and North America, facilitated the dispersal of these species. Once these species established themselves in new territories, they underwent evolution, leading to the diversity we observe today.\n\nAnother prediction of evolution is that species in a particular region should be descendants of earlier species that inhabited the same area. This prediction is supported by fossil records. For example, fossil wambats that most closely resemble modern wambats are found exclusively in Australia. Similarly, the unique armadillos of the Americas, with their bony armor, have fossil relatives called glyptodonts, also exclusive to the Americas. These glyptodonts were massive, armored herbivores that resembled oversized armadillos.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3.14: Fossil and living organisms in the same region are more similar to each other than they are to organisms from other regions, referred to as “succession”\n\n\n\n\n\n3.7.2 Smaller scale, microgeographic patterns of similarity in island chains\nOn a smaller, island-like scale, descent with modification successfully predicts explains a number of observed patterns:\n\nisland fauna and flora tend to be subsets of those found on nearby continents, though the distribution of species tend to be unbalanced. For example, we usually find island systems having plants, birds, insects (flying mostly), and bats that are quite similar to nearby continental ecosystems, while oftentimes completely lacking amphibians, mammals (except bats), reptiles, and fish. Of course this is not always the case as it depends on the distance of the islands from the mainland, the surrounding oceanic currents, and the dispersal ability of the species (in addition to pure luck).\nisland fauna are more similar to adjacent mainland forms, even when environments differ, than they are to island forms from other regions (even when environments the same).\npatterns of similarity among island forms within a chain (e.g. archepelegoes like Hawai’i) often conform to patterns of origins and distributions of islands – i.e., patterns of similarity among organisms follow those predicted based on when islands originate, when they could be colonized, etc. Spectacular examples of these include the Honey-creepers of the Hawai’in islands (and numerous other species as well), and of course the mockingbrids of Darwin fame in the Galapagos.\n\n\n\n3.7.3 Summarizing biogeographic evidence\nThe main lesson from biogeographic patterns is that evolution provides the only explanation for the distribution and diversity of life on continents and islands. It is a mixture of both prediction and retrodiction, consistent with and explained by how evoution works.\nToday these patterns of distribution in species within and among continents and island systems are only reinforced by the deluge of molecular data in the form of levels of sequence divergence and phylogenetic trees. It is an absolutely overwhelming body of evidence, seeming to increase in number near exponentially on a yearly basis. In these types of studies, the levels of sequence divergence and the evolutionary relationships shown by phylogenetic analyses are usually consistent with the patterns observed from morphological and species distribution data across various geographic scales.\nThe theory of Plate Tectonics (only recognized and accepted by the scientific community in the mid-to-late 1960s), which unified earlier concepts like Alfred Wegener’s continental drift (proposed in 1912) with new geological evidence, provided a comprehensive explanation for Earth’s geological processes which proved to be consistent not only with observed species distribution patterns, but also the observed levels of sequence and phylogenetic divergence (phylogeographic patterns).\nTaken as a whole, it is unarguable that biogeographic and phylogeographic patterns provide strong evidence for evolution.",

    "text": "3.8 Deep Time\nThe last prediction of Darwin’s idea of descent with modification is that Earth and life on it are old. The study of the age of Earth and the universe is not really a subject of biology (hence, I will only touch on this briefly). The age of Earth is chiefly studied by geologists who combine isotopic analyses with an understanding of radioactive decay (radiometric dating), and they have established that Earth is about 4.54 billion years old (see Paul Braterman’s article in Scientific American if you want more information). Similarly, astronomers have estimated the age of the universe at 13.8 billion years by measuring the rate of expansion of the universe and extrapolating back to the Big Bang (see Ethan Siegel’s article in Forbes). Evidence for the age of life on Earth comes unsurprisingly from the fossil record. The oldest known fossils are cyanobacteria found in Australian rock formations. Radiometric dating has revealed that they are 3.5 billion years old. Hence, all evidence indicates that life on Earth has had incredibly long periods of time to evolve and create the diversity of organisms observable today.",

    "section": "3.9 Correspondence of Different Lines of Evidence",
    "text": "3.9 Correspondence of Different Lines of Evidence\nInference in science is strongest when there is a clear correspondence between different lines of evidence that all support a central hypothesis (consilience). In fact, we can often use existing information to formulate testable hypotheses that then can be addressed with alternative approaches. You have already learned about one such example in the context of pseudogenes. Estimating the age of pseudogenes by tallying the number of mutations between a pseudogene and its functional equivalent led to clear predictions about the phylogenetic distribution of pseudogenes to test for common ancestry.\nThe discovery of Tiktaalik, a transitional fossil between aquatic and terrestrial vertebrates discovered by a research team around Neil Shubin (Figure 3.15), is another example for the role of interdisciplinary research in making discoveries that transform our understanding. Tiktaalik was not discovered haphazardly by a bunch of rock-loving paleontologists that were just looking for fossils. Its discovery was deliberate and testimony to the power of the scientific method. Wanting to find a transitional fossil that exhibited characteristics of both fish and early tetrapods, Shubin and his team first turned to molecular phylogenetic analyses of vertebrates. Essentially, they used DNA sequences to not only infer the evolutionary relationships between different vertebrate groups but also to date when different lineages split from each other (we will learn exactly how this works in Chapter 7). These analyses revealed that terrestrial vertebrates (Tetrapoda) are sister to the lungfishes (Dipnoi), a lineage from which they split between 350-425 million years ago (Figure 3.16). Any transitional fossils that exhibit traits intermediate between the two groups should consequently be found in rock layers of about that age. Accordingly, Shubin and colleagues took out a geological map of Earth in search of exposed rock formations of the correct age range, and they found some on Ellesmere Island in the Nunavut Territory of Canada. After a few disappointing field seasons, Shubin and his team indeed found a fossil with the predicted combination of traits in 2004. Tiktaalik roseae, as they named the newly discovered species, exhibited gills and scales like fish but also limb bones characteristic of today’s land animals (Daeschler et al. 2006). It’s the combination of multiple approaches rooted in molecular biology, evolutionary analyses, and paleontology that ultimately led to the discovery of this missing link. Looking for corresponding evidence from different research approaches leads to the most robust inference in science, an approach frequently used in evolutionary biology.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExplore More\n\n\n\nIf you want to learn more about the fascinating discovery of Tiktaalik and its implications for evolution and our own origins, I recommend you either read Neil Shubin’s book “Your Inner Fish” or watch the PBS series based on the book.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3.15\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3.16: A simplified phylogenetic tree of vertebrates.

    "text": "3.10 Absence of Evidence…\nA frequent argument of critics of evolutionary theory (and science in general) is that we cannot explain everything, and indeed there are some major open questions that remain largely unaddressed: How did life on Earth originate? What were the characteristics of the last universal common ancestor of Archaea, Bacteria, and Eukaryotes? How and why did the eukaryotic cell arise? How did the transitional forms between some major taxonomic groups look like? Why is it that so many species reproduce by having sex?\nThe fact that we do not know the answers to these questions, and many others like them, does not undermine what we do know about evolution and science. It is precisely why evolutionary biology is an exciting field of research. More importantly, absence of evidence is not evidence for absence. For example, gaps in the fossil record and a lack of transitional forms between some taxonomic groups does not negate what we have learned about evolutionary patterns and processes. Perhaps some of these key fossils have just not been found yet, or they may be completely lost to time (because fossilization is actually a rare process). Ultimately, the probability that evolution is true based on other evidence is high enough that a lack of a specific fossil cannot call it into question. Only novel evidence—for example, new fossils that directly contradict our current understanding—has the potential to reshape evolutionary biology. In other words, the burden of proof about any inaccuracies in our current understanding of evolution lies with the critic and not the untouched gaps in our current understanding. And as scientists, it is our day-to-day business to detect and correct those inaccuracies, rather than defending the status quo blindly.",

In all the decades since Darwin first proposed this theory of evolution, there has not been a single instance of evidence inconsistent with the interpretation that evolution is the only scientific explanation for the diversity of life. There certainly have been a lot of opinions and attempts to come up with alternative explanations (for example creation science and intelligent design), yet not a single one of these alternatives have withstood the cold, harsh filter of empirical science. Strong beliefs or opinions are not scientific evidence.\nIn other words, there is no controversy to teach regarding the validity of evolutionary theory. The perceived controversy exists solely in the realms of politics and religion, not science. Evolution is a decided fact.",

    "text": "4.1 A Mechanism for Change\nDarwin’s core contribution to science was not just his assemblage of evidence for the pattern of evolution, but also the conception of a mechanism that could explain such patterns: natural selection. In doing so, he formalized an idea that humans have used for millennia to shape traits of agricultural crops, livestock, and companion animals. If you weed out the duds and promote the variants you desire, you end up with giant potatoes, hens that lay over 300 eggs a year, pigs that produce the most scrumptious bacon, and the most adorable puppies that steal your well-bred breakfast.\nHumans have been domesticating plants and animals for various purposes for over 10,000 years, thereby shaping their evolution. The recipe for success was relatively simple: assess the traits of individuals in your stock, choose the ones with the desired traits for breeding, and keep doing just that, time and time again. While we—as humans—have a long history of selective breeding, it does not actually take that much time for artificial selection to have profound effects. The speed at which we can domesticate animals was illustrated by an experiment that aimed to better understand the evolution of dogs from wolves by selectively breeding foxes.\nIn 1959, Lyudmila Trut and Dmitri Belyaev started to selectively breed silver foxes (Vulpes vulpes) in a Russian fur farm (Dugatkin 2018). Breeders were selected based on their tameness. Foxes that were curious toward humans were retained, while those that were shy or even aggressive… well, they became coats for the Russian elite. Over a few decades, foxes in this experiment not only became tamer and tamer, but they also exhibited changes in a variety of other traits: their facial structure diverged, some exhibited floppy ears and curly tails, their coat colors changed, and some even started to make novel sounds (seriously… read about Pushinka the Barking Fox). Today, the foxes of this experiment still contribute to fur production, but you can also buy domesticated foxes as pets, even here in the United States. Selection on an apparently simple trait (tamness) lead to complex changes in the fox population in just a few decades.\nDarwin, through his experience with pigeon breeding, was not only aware of the power of selective breeding and domestication, but he was also able to relate that process to the patterns of evolutionary change he observed in nature. This chapter will take you through Darwin’s logic of natural selection.",

    "section": "4.2 Darwin’s (and Wallace’s) Logic",
    "text": "4.2 Darwin’s (and Wallace’s) Logic\nNatural selection explains evolution based on first principles; deceivingly simple and equally powerful. Darwin made four key observations, also know as Darwin’s postulates:\n\nIndividuals in a population vary in their traits.\nSome of that trait variation is inherited from parents to their offspring.\nMore offspring are produced in every generation than can possibly survive.\nSuccessful survival and reproduction of those offspring is not random but dependent on the traits they inherited from their parents.\n\nIf these four observations hold true, then the consequence is that the heritable traits that impact survival and reproduction will change from one generation to the next. Beneficial variants will become more common through time, ultimately causing adaptation to the prevailing environmental conditions.\nWhile we intuitively know at least some of Darwin’s postulates to be true, we should treat them all as hypotheses. We cannot only test whether the predictions of each postulate hold up, but we can also empirically test whether evolutionary change is really the consequence of the four postulates. In the following sections, we will take a closer look at the four postulates and discuss an actual case study of natural selection in the wild, building on what you learned about Darwin’s finches in the last chapter.\n\n4.2.1 Variation\nIndividuals in a population vary in their traits. We know this to be true in humans; if you just look around the classroom, inter-individual differences become evident in many traits. While nearly all humans have one head, two eyes and ears, and five digits on each limb, we vary in body size, the relative proportions of morphological traits, the color of our skin, hair, and eyes, aspects of our physiology, as well as behavioral traits that make up our personalities. If you have ever cared for pets or plants in a garden, you will have some intuition about trait variation in those species, too.\nFrom a practical perspective, the question is not so much whether individuals in a population vary, but which variable traits are actually important from a functional perspective. In other words, what traits should we actually be paying attention to as evolutionary biologists? For example, some humans have hair on their phalanges and some don’t. Does that matter? Probably not… This is where careful natural history observations come into play. To ask meaningful questions about evolution in natural systems, we have to consider organisms as holistic entities consisting of interacting traits in the context of the abiotic and biotic factors comprising their environment. So before going out into natural populations and quantifying variation, we want to formulate concrete hypotheses about the role of specific traits in shaping organismal performance in terms of survival and reproduction.\nOnce relevant traits for study have been identified, quantifying actual trait variation is not too difficult. It is amazing what ground-breaking data sets were collected merely using a caliper. But depending on the nature of a trait, any other method might be used to quantify inter-individual differences, from the molecular composition of cells all the way up to behavioral responses. Variation of traits among individuals in a population is typically visualized using frequency histograms (like in Figure @ref(fig:beaksizevariation)), and most traits in natural populations exhibit a normal distribution, where most individuals have intermediate trait values, and extreme trait values are more rare. We will explore why this is in Chapter 8.\nUltimately, any variation we can observe and quantify in a population represents the raw material of evolution. Selection can act on variable traits, potentially causing evolutionary change—if said trait is heritable. If there is no variation, there can be no selection and accordingly no evolution, no matter how heritable a trait is.\n\n\n4.2.2 Heritability\nOnce variation in a potentially interesting trait is quantified, we have to test whether trait variation is heritable. Many—if not all—quantitative traits are not only shaped by genes inherited by the parents, but also by environmental factors. For example, a child’s potential to grow tall is dependent on whether their parents were tall (i.e., variation in genes that mediate growth) as well as adequate access to resources during the critical times in development. Similarly, the expression of certain colors in insects, fish, and birds is dependent on access to nutritional precursors and the genetically determined physiological capacity to turn those precursors into pigments deposited in tissues. Genetic and environmental effects work together to shape the variation of traits that we observe. So how can we determine the relative contribution of each?\nHeritability measures the degree to which variation in a trait in a population is due to genetic variation. Thus, it is not a metric we can establish for a particular individual or a particular family; rather, we need to quantify the correspondence of parent and offspring traits across multiple families in a population. We can then plot offspring trait values as a function of their parents’ trait values and calculate regression lines. The slope of those parent-offspring regressions is a measure of heritability (in particular, narrow-sense heritability, but we will learn more about this in Chapter 8). If the slope of the parent-offspring regression is close to one, it means there is almost perfect correspondence between parent and offspring traits, and heritability is high (blue line in Figure @ref(fig:herit)). If the slope of the line is close to zero, there is no correspondence between parent and offspring traits; in this case, phenotypic variation is entirely shaped by environmental influences, and there is no heritability (green line in Figure @ref(fig:herit)). Any slopes between zero and one (like the orange line in Figure @ref(fig:herit)) indicate that genetic and environmental factors both contribute to shaping trait variation in a population.\n\n\nWarning: Using `size` aesthetic for lines was deprecated in ggplot2 3.4.0.\nℹ Please use `linewidth` instead.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe slope of parent-offspring regressions reveal the degree of heritability. A slope of one indicates high heritability (blue line), while a slope of zero indicates no heritability (orange line). Intermediate slopes indicate that genetic and environmental effects both impact trait variation in a population.\n\n\n\n\nJust like variation is required for there to be selection, heritability is required to translate selection into evolutionary change. If there is no heritability in a trait, it cannot evolve. Evolutionary change in a trait is consequently not only shaped by selection, but also by the degree to which the trait is heritable.\n\n\n4.2.3 The Struggle for Existence\nAll organisms have the potential to produce more offspring than required to replace themselves. Hence, all populations have the potential for exponential growth. We see evidence for such exponential growth whenever we inoculate a Petri dish with bacteria, when invasive species are introduced into a new area, or when pathogens spread through a population of susceptible hosts. But eventually, exponential growth comes to an end when resources get more scarce and competition intensifies. Nutrients on the agar will dwindle, invasives gradually encroach on all available spaces, and hosts either die off or develop immunity. Resource limitation and competition ultimately stifle exponential growth, and thus, natural population growth is typically density-dependent, which can be described using logistic growth cruves. During logistic growth, a carrying capacity sets the threshold beyond which positive population growth becomes impossible, because the resources to sustain additional population growth are not available.\nDarwin was not the first to recognize the relationship between population growth and resource availability. In fact, he was inspired by an earlier economist, Thomas Malthus, who voiced concerns in the late 1700s about the growth of agricultural food production lagging behind human population growth. Although the industrial and agricultural revolutions proved Malthus wrong (global food production largely kept pace with human population growth), he was right about one thing: the growth of any population can only continue if its resources grow as well. Hence, most natural populations remain relatively stable through time despite the potential for exponential population growth (Figure @ref(fig:elephants)), aside from comparatively minor fluctuations across seasons and years.\n\n\n\n\n\nEven animals with slow reprodictive rates have the potential for exponential growth. Depicted is the population size of African elephants in Kruger National Park, South Africa, after they were protected from hunting.\n\n\n\n\nSo where do all the extra offspring go? They die! Most individuals born succumb to a lack of resources, predators, or diseases long before they reach sexual maturity, and only a small fraction of offspring born in any generation survive long enough to reproduce. The consequence of this overproduction is fierce competition in every generation. This competition is what Darwin referred to as the struggle for existence. Natural selection is often particularly intense in populations that are close to their carrying capacity and in populations that are contracting.\n\n\n4.2.4 Non-Random Survival and Reproduction\nDarwin’s final proposition was that winners and losers in the struggle for existence are not determined by chance. Instead, specific traits and trait combinations lead to a higher probability of survival and reproduction. In a landscape plagued by drought, it is the plant with the deepest roots that has the best chance of persisting. In an stream rich in predators, the fish with the fastest escape response is most likely to dodge imminent attacks. In a forest with limited food resources, the parrot with the most efficient foraging strategy can garner enough food resources to produce and feed a clutch of young. Depending on the challenge at hand, individuals with specific traits or trait combinations will have a slight advantage over others.\nImportantly, natural selection is not random. That does not mean natural selection is guided by conscious intent, as sometimes is insinuated. Rather, natural selection just happens because some variants have a disproportionate likelihood to survive and reproduce. As a consequence of natural selection’s non-random nature, evolution by natural selection increases adaptation from one generation to the next.\nA concept related to natural selection is fitness, which is used to describe the strength of natural selection on different variants. Fitness in biology is not a measure of an individual’s physical prowess or health, but rather the relative contribution of a particular phenotype to the gene pool of the next generation.\n::: callout-note {#nte-fitness} #### Some definitions\nNatural selection -a difference on average between survival and fecundity of individuals with certain phenotypes compared with individuals of other phenotypes.\nFitness - The relative ability of individuals to survive and reproduce in its environment. Fitness quantifies individual reproductive success and represents the average contribution to the gene pool of the next (and subsequent) generation(s) by individuals of the specified phenotype in a given environment either via differential survival or reproductive success.\nAdaptation - Character that increases the ability of an individual to survive or reproduce compared with some alternative trait or form of the character; trait that increases fitness relative to individuals lacking that trait.\nPreadaptation (exaptation) - Pre-existing character whose function changes to serve a new adaptive purpose.\nMaladaptation - :::\nFitness is relative in the sense that it is typically expressed for one phenotype in relation to another. For example, the fitness of mouse with a dark fur coat is higher relative to the fitness of a mouse with a light fur coat, because the darker coat color increases crypsis against the dark leaf litter of the forest habitat. Fitness is also context-dependent, and the relative fitness of two phenotypes may change depending on the environmental conditions. For example, in a mouse population inhabiting beaches, the light colored phenotype may have higher fitness, because it is better camouflaged against the light sand.",

    "text": "4.3 Putting Darwin’s Logic to the Test\nThe core strength of Darwin’s postulates is that they can be treated as hypotheses, and we can use data from natural populations to test whether evolution by natural selection is happening. In this section, we will once again retrace the steps of Rosemary and Peter Grant. In Chapter 2, you explored their data on beak size variation of the Geospiza fortis population on Daphne Major Island (Figure @ref(fig:timeseries)). During a massive drought associated with an El Niño in 1977, there was a substantial increase of beak size over a short period of time. But does this change represent an evolutionary change caused by natural selection? If so, we would predict (1) observable variation in beak size in the G. fortis population, (2) that some of the beak size variation is heritable, (3) that the finches on Daphne Major are in fact facing a struggle for existence, and (4) that survival in the finch population is not random but related to beak size. Last but not least, we would also predict differences in beak size across generations.\n\n\n\n\n\nVariation of relative beak size in G. fortis on Daphne Major Island from 1972-1995. Positive numbers indicate larger beaks and negative number represent smaller beaks.\n\n\n\n\n\n4.3.1 Is there Variation in Beak Size?\nTo test whether there is variation in beak size within the G. fortis population, we can use a frequency histogram to plot raw beak size data collected by the Grants (Figure @ref(fig:beaksizevariation)). As with most quantitative traits, beak size variation follows a normal distribution, with most individuals exhibiting intermediate beak sizes around 9.5 mm. However, the spread in beak sizes is vast; the smallest beaks measured just 6 mm, and the largest ones almost 14 mm. That is more than a two-fold spread! Therefore, there is clear variation in beak size that natural selection could potentially act upon; i.e., we found evidence for Darwin’s first postulate.\n\n\n\n\n\nFrequency histogram showing beak size variation in the G. fortis population before the drought in 1976. Data from Boag and Grant (1984).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n4.3.2 Is Variation in Beak Size Heritable?\nTo test whether beak size is heritable, the Grants tracked the development of individuals by banding them with unique markers and comparing beak sizes of parents and their adult offspring. Plotting the average beak size of each parental pair against the average beak size of their offspring reveals a clear positive relationship between the two variables, both for families studied in 1976 and 1978 (Figure @ref(fig:heritability)). Parents with large beaks tended to raise chicks with large beaks, and parents with small beaks had chicks with small beaks. The slope of the regression lines for both years is almost 0.9, indicating a high heritability. So, beak size is not only variable but also highly heritable, providing evidence for Darwin’s second postulate.\n\n\n\n\n\nScatter plot showing the relationship between the beak size of the parents (average between mother and father) and their offspring (average across multiple siblings) measured separately in 1976 and 1978. Data from Boag (1983).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n4.3.3 Is there a Struggle for Existence?\nAs with any population that has a capacity for exponential growth and is trapped in a small area, the struggle for existence in Darwin’s finches seems obvious, but election can be particularly strong when conditions are harsh and populations are contracting. Throughout the 1977 drought, finch populations on Daphne Major crashed from about 1,500 birds in March 1976 to to less than 200 birds in late 1977 (Figure @ref(fig:popsize)). This represents a decline of over 85 % in less than two years. The Grants were able to show that this decline was primarily related to a limitation of food resources, as the lack of significant precipitation limited plant growth and seed production on the island. Consequently, the Grants witnessed struggle for existence first hand, finding support of Darwin’s third postulate.\n\n\n\n\n\nPopulation size of G. fortis on Daphne Major between July 1975 and January 1979. Data from Boag and Grant (1981).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n4.3.4 Is Survival Non-Random?\nTo test whether survival of birds was non-random in relation to beak size, we can compare the beak size distribution in individuals before the drought in 1976 and the birds that were left after the drought in 1978. As you can see in Figure @ref(fig:survival), surviving birds on average had a larger beak size than individuals prior to the selection event. The Grants were also able to explain exactly why a larger beak size conferred a selective advantage. As the drought progressed, there was not only a decline in seed abundance, but the average seed also became larger and harder, because the smaller and softer seeds were eventually all eaten up by the finches. As seed quality changed, finches with larger beaks had a foraging advantage, because they were able to open larger and harder seeds more effectively. The disproportionate survival of individuals with larger beaks provides clear evidence for Darwin’s fourth postulate.\n\n\n\n\n\nFrequency histograms showing beak size variation in the finch population before the drought (top) and in the surviving individuals after the drought (bottom). The vertical red lines represent the mean beak size in each set. The beak size of the average survivor was slightly higher than the population average prior to the drought, indicating that natural selection happened. Data from Boag and Grant (1984).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n4.3.5 Did Non-Random Survival Lead to Evolution?\nAt this stage, we have shown heritable variation in beak size, strong selection caused by a massive drought, and non-random survival associated with beak size. However, we have not yet shown that evolution has occurred. We have only shown the action of natural selection. But testing the hypothesis of evolutionary change requires the documentation of changes across generations, not just differential survival within generations. To do so, we can can compare the beak size of offspring born before the drought (1976) to the beak size of offspring both after the drought (in 1978; these are the offspring of the survivors). As expected, based on the high heritability of beak size, we see that the average offspring in 1978 exhibited a larger beak than the average offspring in 1976 (Figure @ref(fig:evolutionarychange)).\nTaken together, these data sets conclusively show that the drastic change in beak size from 1976 to 1978 (Figure @ref(fig:timeseries)) represents evolution by natural selection. The finch population adapted to a new reality, where the average food source was larger and harder. The Grants’ pioneering work linked an evolutionary pattern that they observed to a concrete mechanism that explained the pattern; they documented the interplay of pattern and process in a naturally evolving population.\n\n\n\n\n\nFrequency histograms showing beak size variation in the finch offspring born before the drought (top) and after the drought (bottom). The vertical red lines represent the mean beak size in each set. The beak size of the average offspring born after the selection event was higher than the offspring average prior, indicating that evolution happened. Data from Grant and Grant 2003.",

    "section": "4.5 Some clarifications on natural selection, or the Nature of Natural Selection",
    "text": "4.5 Some clarifications on natural selection, or the Nature of Natural Selection\nIn its most simplest form, natural selection is a fundamental concept in evolutionary biology that describes the process by which organisms with advantageous traits are more likely to survive and reproduce, passing those traits on to future generations. This was Darwin’s revolutionary concept, a mechanism that could explain the origin of species. So simple and elegant a concept. Yet, as we discussed in the Chapter 5, it would take well over a half century until natural selection was generally accepted as one of the primary drivers of the diversication of life. Even today there remains a lot of misunderstandings on how natural actually works. In this section we will explore and hopefully dispell some of the more lingering misunderstandings concerning the nature of natural selection.\n\nNatural selection acts on individuals, but its consequences are expressed at the population level. Specifically, selection operates on phenotypes, the observable characteristics of organisms. For any one character, if there is variation for a character in a population and that variation results in some individuals able to survive or reproduce better than others in the population with a different value for that character, then the frequency of the favored phenotype will increase in the population. Selection does not change the individual, but simply causes it to increase in frequency in the population. The consequence of selection acting on the individual level (differential survive or reproduction), the impact is on the population level (i.e. changing the frequency of the phenotypic values).\nSelection acts on phenotypes, results in changes in allele frequencies. In order for natural selection to be effective across generations, the phenotypic character must be heritable to some extent, i.e. there must be a genetic basis to the variation found in the character in the populations. If true, then any change in the frequency of a heritable phenotype in population will result in changes in allele frequencies at the genes underlying the phenotypic variation within a population over time.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nThe idea of changes in allele frequencies is very classical way of thinking about this. From a more genomic perspective, the variation does not have be at the gene/allele level (where we formally define a gene as a region of the genome that is transcribed into a functional product). As we learn more about genome anatomies and the genome-phenome connection, we are finding that a lot of phenotypic variation is not necessarily driven by variation at genes in the formal sense, i.e. nucleotide polymorphisms in a protein coding region. Any variation in the genome that influences the character value (phenotype) will increase in frequency, be that an allele (variant form of a gene), a SNP, at a regulatory region, intergenic (between genes), or even a Structural Variant (SV).\nSo, though we will be discussing various selection models and their impact on allele frequencies, keep the above in mind. We are very loosely defining allele to include most any genomic variation, and not just at the gene level.\n\n\n\nSelection depends on the immediate environment of an organism. The environment plays a pivotal role in natural selection, as it provides the context in which selection occurs. Interestingly, organisms can also influence their environment, creating a dynamic interplay between the two. However, natural selection is not a forward-looking process. It is the outcome of differences in survival and reproduction among existing variants in a population at that given moment in time. Natural selection will not select variants because they might prove useful in the future. It is pure here and now, acting on pre-existing variants from yesterday to determine the winners today.\nLevels of Selection. While selection acts on individuals, the consequences of selection can result in higher order patterns to a limited extent (e.g. group selection). However, there is no strong evidence that group selection (as formally defined) occurs. Instead, natural section will always work to increase the population fitness by favoring individual organisms with the higher fitness. The consequences of this may look like group selection, but it is not: selection does not act for the good of the population or species. Seemingly altruistic traits or selfless behaviors, which appear to benefit a species or population, actually reflect an increase in a type of fitness referred to as inclusive fitness.\nNatural selection does not cause adaptive changes to arise. Instead, it causes adaptive traits to become more frequent in a population, i.e. acts on preexisting variation. Mutations, which are the ultimate source of genetic variation, occur randomly with respect to fitness or necessity. Most mutations are deleterious, some neutral, and every once in awhile advantageous. It is these advantageous mutations that increase in frequency in a population due to natural selection. There is no solid evidence for directed mutation, i.e. specific mutations that purposely occur to benefit an individual.\nDespite acting only on pre-existing traits, selection can produce new traits and adaptations. There are various ways new traits can arise. For example:\n\nShifting distributions of traits\nGradual change over time\nAlterations in developmental pathways\n\nThe combination of variation and natural selection can lead to the evolution of completely novel features. There is no need for large phenotypic changes (saltations) to occur via mutation to explain the origin of completely novel features, though this does not preclude that happening. By acting on pre-existing characters, completely novel characters can arise either slowly over evolutionary time or quite rapidly. There is plenty of evidence for natural selection acting on a pre-existing character, changing it serve a new novel purpose, what we refer to as an exaptation. There is plenty of evidence for exaptations at the molecular level, but we can also find morphological exaptations as well.\nNatural selection does not lead to perfection. Adaptations often appear cobbled together and highly inefficient (certainly not something any intelligent designer would come up with if they wanted to keep their job). Natural selection only works on pre-existing variation. Because of the nature of natural selection, a variant form of a character just has to work better (on average) than other versions of the character in a population. If it does, and the variation has a genetic basis, it will increase in frequency in the populations. It just needs to be better, not the best. It does not mean the end result has to be the fastest or strongest or meanest. It just has to work better than others.\nThere are limitations and constraints on natural selection. It’s important to recognize that there are all manner of limitations on natural selection driven by the fundamental rules of physics and chemistry, and basic biological limitations. These constraints include:\n\nTime lags: Evolutionary changes may not keep pace with environmental changes.\nConstraints: - Mechanical constraints (physics & chemistry), genetic or developmental links between traits/genes, or even just a lack of variation (this is a big one) all place boundaries on how natural selection can work\nTradeoffs: Improving one trait may come at the cost of another.\nHistorical contingency: Past evolutionary events can limit future possibilities simply because the necessary biochemical or developmental pathways are not available (lacking in ancestors).\n\nComplexity and Progression. Despite these limitations, natural selection can lead to extraordinary complexity. However, it’s crucial to understand that while selection is nonrandom, it is not necessarily progressive; it does not always lead to greater organismal complexity. If it is beneficial for an individual to lose some characteristic compare to others in the population that retain it, then selection can act on to reduce organismal complexity just as well (consider parasites for example). This does not mean there are no patterns or trends in the evolutionary record. It simply means that there is no driving force toward some a priori outcome. Remember, selection is about the here-and-now, not some preferred outcome.\nThere is no inherent drive towards balancing nature or achieving harmony or equilibrium.\nEthical Considerations. Natural selection is fundamentally an amoral process (neither moral nor immoral). It simply lacks any ethical qualities. It is often described as a selfish, dark, and aesthetically unappealing process. As such, there are no great moral lessons to be learned from natural selection or the adaptations it drives.\n\nIt’s crucial to avoid the naturalistic fallacy (the supposition that what is natural is inherently good) when thinking about natural and how evolution by natural selection works. Natural selection provides no code of ethics, no moral compass, and no justification for behaviors. It merely describes what is, not what ought to be.",

That being the case, explaining how a particular character may be an adaptation requires that we follow the “rule” of natural science, which means developing hypotheses, testing hypotheses and predictions, collecting relevant data, and analyzing and interpreting those data. Simply claiming that a character is an adaptation because you have a story that sounds good is not sound science. Until you can demonstrate empirical data that supports your story, it will still only remain a story regardless of how compelling it sounds.\nRecognizing and studying adaptations involves several approaches:\n\nComplexity: If a character is complex, it is more likely to be the result of natural selection.\nDesign: Characters that appear intricately designed for a specific environment are likely products of natural selection.\nExperimental evidence: Direct tests of adaptive hypotheses.\nComparative method: Used to account for common ancestry when comparing traits across species.\n\nThe first two approaches really should be starting points for developing hypotheses and predictions that can be tested using the last two, experimental evidence (both in the field and/or laboratory) and using the comparative method. We will discuss the comparative method later in the OER after we learn a little more about how to interpret and construct evolutionary trees.\nIn conclusion, natural selection is a powerful yet constrained process that shapes the diversity of life on Earth.

Why did beak sizes not continue to increase or remain stable at a larger size?\nIn The Origin of Species, Darwin said:\n\n“As natural selection works solely by and for the good of each being, all corporeal and mental endowments will tend to progress toward perfection.”\nDarwin, 1859\n\nWhat do you think of this statement?

    "text": "5.1 What is an evolutionary tree\nRecall from Chapter 2 that one of Darwin’s great contributions was the idea that new species are formed by the splitting off from a pre-existing ancestor, forming a tree-like structure with species diverging from a common ancestor. As early as 1837, a year after he returned from his voyage on the Beagle, Darwin sketched in one of his notebooks a branching diagram representing the idea of descent from common ancestors, an image today that remains an icon of evolutionary thinking. Though there are others that were kind-of thinking along similar lines of “divergence from a common ancestor” and showing these relationships not as a linear process but more tree-like, it was Darwin who should and does get the most credit. He took this simple yet elegant idea of descent with modification as envisioned by a branching tree-like structure, and extrapolated it to all of life. In OTOS he wrote:\nIt is clear that Darwin considered this Tree Of Life as a fundamentally important to understanding “descent with modification”, so much so that the only figure found in the OTOS is a hand drawn branching diagram that today we would call an evolutionary tree, or phylogeny.\nToday, evolutionary trees form the bedrock of modern evolutionary biology. Understanding how to correctly interpret evolutionary trees is absolutely essential to understanding modern evolutionary biology. This is true beyond understanding the relationship of closely related species, but ranges across the hierarchy of life, from the grand Tree Of Life on down to genes and proteins. Constructing evolutionary trees used to be difficult, sometimes highly subjective, certainly loaded with conflict. It took the better part of 30 years to resolve the issues surrounding the methodologies to constructing reliable evolutionary trees, with much of the progress driven by advances in molecular and genomic biology, statistics, and computer science.\nIn this chapter we will introduce phylogenetic trees with an emphasis on interpreting and understanding what they are, what they can tell us, and some common mistakes in interpreting evolutionary relationships from phylogenies to try to avoid. Later in the semester we will study how to actually build evolutionary trees in lecture and lab. But before we dive into the basics of evolutionary trees and how to understand and use them, we need to make a clear distinction between what we mean by Classification/Taxonomy and phylogenetics.",

    "text": "5.2 Classification and phylogenetics\nThough closely related, Classification, and by extension Taxonomy, is in fact distinct from phylogenetics.\n\n\nPhylogenetic tree is an estimate of the evolutionary relationship among groups of taxa, where taxa can be genes, populations, species, and even higher order groups. As such, we consider phylogenies to be hypotheses that can/will change as new evidence, data, or methodologies emerge.\nClassification schemes are systems used to categorize and organize living organisms into unique groups. Their main purpose is to identify, name, and categorize organisms in some way that makes sense, usually by some measure of similarity (e.g. morphology). They tend to be rather stable.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportant\n\n\n\nImportant: do not let me confuse you…\nThroughout this OER I will be using the terms phylogenies and evolutionary trees interchangeably. They essentially mean the same thing, and I will use either one kind of arbitrarily depending on how it sounds or what is in my notes.\n\n\nThere have been numerous Classification schemes proposed by natural historians over the last century or so, some seemingly more”arbritrary” than others. Today we pretty much rely on a system based on shared characteristics, the so-called Linnaean system, which organizes organisms into hierarchical categories such as Kingdom, Phylum, Class, Order, Family, Genus, and species. I am confident you are comfortable with the Linnaean system, so will not go into much detail.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nIf you need a reminder of what the Linnaean system is, you can refer to this chapter in an online introductory biology textbook, or the this Wikipedia entry.\n\n\nTaxonomy (the science of naming, describing, and classifying organisms into groups based on shared characteristics) is very focused on classification and identification, with a pretty strict set of rules when it comes to naming genera and species (perhaps a little less so at the higher levels). The goal is to assure that no two species bear the same name, such that when you are studying a particular organism, you have a fair amount of confidence that it is what you think it is.\nThough related, Systematics on the other hand focuses on studying the diversity of organisms, investigating evolutionary relationships, and understanding the processes that lead to biodiversity. This includes reconstructing evolutionary histories (phylogenies), analyzing genetic, morphological, and ecological data, and exploring the mechanisms of speciation and adaptation.\nToday, it is agreed that the best classification schemes are those that reflect evolutionary relationships, i.e. phylogenies (though this was not always the case). Most systematists, though there remain a few hold-overs from past antiquated arguments, understand that the best classifications should consist of monophyletic taxa only and thus reflect phylogenetic relationships.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDefinitions: Monophyletic, Paraphyletic, and Polyphyletic\n\n\n\n\nMonophyletic: taxon is one that includes all the named descendants of a particular common ancestor\nParaphyletic: taxon includes some, but not all, of the descendants from a particular ancestor\nPolyphyletic:  taxon includes species that do not exclusively share a common ancestor\n\n\n\n\nWe will dive more into and clarify these terms later. The key points here is that\n\n\nThe best classifications should reflect evolutionary history\nEvolutionary history is best represented by phylogenies.\n\n\nFor the remainder of this chapter we will discuss it is essential to have a clear understanding of what phylogenies are, how they are constructed, and how to interpret them correctly.",

    "section": "5.3 Phylogenetic trees",
    "text": "5.3 Phylogenetic trees\nBefore discussing what the components of an evolutionary tree are, it is worth while to take a step back to discuss the two generalized processes in evolution, namely anagenesis and cladogenesis.\n\nAnagenesis is evolutionary change of features within a single lineage, say a species or a population.\nCladogenesis on the other hand is the branching of a lineage into two or more descendant lineages.\n\nWhen Darwin proposed species forming by splitting from a common ancestor, he was evoking cladogenesis. Cladogenesis is often (but perhaps not always) followed by anagenesis in each of the descendant lineages such that they become different from each other via various mechanisms. This can lead to increasing divergence between the two taxa over time, i.e. divergent evolution. The two processes of anagenesis and cladogenesis can be reflected in phylogenetic trees (depending on the method used to construct the tree): cladogenesis as the branching patterns seen in the tree, and anagenesis by the length of the branches, but only in some specific methods of constructing evolutionary trees. More on this idea of reflecting anagenesis on an evoutionary tree later in this OER.\nOther types of evolutionary phenomena can also be shown on a phylogenetic tree, for example extinction and reticulation (when two lineages merge), but for our purposes, we will focus on what we call a bifurcating tree for the time being.\n\n5.3.1 Anatomy of an evolutionary tree\nBefore describing the components of an evolutionary tree, the following terms are important to understand:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\n\ntopology : this is the branching pattern of tree. It indicates evolutionary relatedness. For example, in th figure above species A and B share a recent common ancestor that was not shared by the other species and are therefore called “sister taxa.” Similarly, species D and E are sister taxa. Species F is the most distantly related of the sample of species and is known as the “outgroup.”\nclade : a relative term for a group of taxa that are related by a common ancestor, or from the opposite perspective, it is all the lineages derived from a single recent common ancestor. For example, in the figure above, A and B can be considered a clade. Likewise A, B, and C can also be considered a clade. D and E can be considered a clade, as can A, B, C, D, & E. However, A and D can not be considered a valid clade, since you are excluding other lineages that are derived from the common ancestor connecting A & D.\nCommon Ancestor (CA) :\nMore Recent Common Ancestor (MRCA) :\n\n\n\nThe following figure is a very simple phylogenetic tree showing the relationship among 6 taxa. Though very simple, it contains most of the key elements found in an evolutionary tree, which are defined below.\n\n\n\nAnatomy of an evolutionary tree (from Gregory 2008)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDEFINITIONS: Anatomy of an evolution tree\n\n\n\n\nTaxa : General term for the items at the ends of a tips of a tree. Taxa can be most anything really, though we usually think of species as taxa. However they can also be genes or regions of a genome, or even higher order systematic levels. It all depends on the what evolutionary history the tree represents. For that reason, you will often see the term OTU (Operational Taxonomic Unit) used in exchange for taxa.\nNode : A branching point in a phylogenetic tree; can be either internal or terminal.\nInternal node : Represents a (hypothetical) common ancestor of two lineages; a splitting event, or inferred lineage splitting (e.g. speciation) events that give rise to descendant sister groups—in other words, they represent the common ancestors from which two or more related lineages are descended.\nTerminal node : Tip of a branch/lineage that defines taxa, e.g. OTU or taxa names.\nBranch : also referred to as a lineage; the “lines” of a phylogenetic tree that connect either two nodes (internal branch) or one node with a tip (terminal branch); also called edges.\nRoot : If the tree is rooted, the node/branch at the base of the tree; represents the most basal portion of the tree, or the most recent common ancestor (MRCA) of all the taxa on the tree.\nOutgroup : In a rooted tree, a taxa or group of taxa used to define the root the tree. The outgroup IS NOT the root of the tree, but helps to define where the root of the tree is. The root indicate the last common ancestor (i.e., the deepest internal node) shared by the entire group of species. The term basal lineage is sometimes used to describe the outgroup, but this term if often misunderstood so best not to even use it.\nIngroup : Those taxa that are of primary interest, i.e. the taxa for wish you wish you estimate the evolutionary relationship\n\n\n\nGenerally speaking, there is some level of directionality to the tree if it is a rooted tree such that the base or root of the tree represents the past (more ancient) while the tips are the more recent (present). This does not mean that all trees accurately represent when a particular lineage diverged. That requires a special type of tree, which we will explain later. At this point, understand that the root of the tree is the most ancestral, while the terminal nodes (tips) are the most recent.\n\n\n5.3.2 Evolutionary relationships are determined by the sharing of common ancestry\nSince evolution occurs via the splitting from a common ancestor, then we define evolutionary relationships via the sharing of common ancestry. If two taxa share a more recent common ancestor with each other than they do with a third taxa, then those two taxa are more closely related to each other than they are to the third. As with the discussion on tree as mobiles, it is all about the sharing of Most Recent Common Ancestry (MRCA).\nPerhaps an example will help. Panel A in the figure below shows a well accepted phylogeny or the Old World primates.\n\n\n\nPrimate evolutionary tree\n\n\nTo determine evolutionary relationships, basically you simply trace down the tree to find that internal node that connects the two taxa of interest; that node represents their MRCA. Based on tree in Panel (B), we would say the humans are more closely related to chimpanzees than they are to gorillas since they share a MRCA (node 1, path in red) with chimps than they do with gorillas (node 2, path in green). Likewise, as shown in Panel (C), humans are more closely related to gorillas than they are to orangutans since they share a MRCA with gorillas (node 2, path in green) than they do with Orangutans (node 3, path in orange).\nA source of confusion to many students when they first try to make this transition to “tree thinking” is that they tend to focus on the number of nodes connecting two taxa rather than the sharing of a MCRA. For example, in Panel (D) in the figure above we would say that Gibbons are equally related to Orangutans as they are to Chimpanzees since Gibbons share the same MRCA (node 4) with Orangutans (path in blue) as they do with Chimpanzees (path in purple). Even though when tracing back through the tree we pass by only 3 nodes between Gibbons and Orangutans (path in blue) but 6 nodes between Gibbons and Chimpanzees (path in purple), from an evolutionary perspective we would still consider Gibbons to be equally related to Orangutans as they are to Chimpanzees: it is the sharing of the MRCA (node 4) that determines evolutionary relationship, not how many evolutionary events occurred after splitting from that common ancestor.\nAnother source of confusion some students have is tending to equate evolutionary relationship as shown by a phylogeny with evolutionary divergence. Though these two concepts can be related, they need not be. Divergence is some measure of how different two taxa are, be that from a genomic or phenotypic perspective. A lineage can undergo extensive divergence from a sister taxa after splitting from a common ancestor (remember anagenesis?), yet the evolutionary relationship as demonstrated by the topology of an evolutionary tree would be just the same even if there was little divergence. The lesson here is to be careful about the language being used, such that we are not confusing these two very important processes.\n\n\n5.3.3 Evolutionary trees are like mobiles\nEvolutionary trees are actually two dimensional representations of a three dimensional object, like a mobile lying on the table. If you were to pick the mobile up and hang it on the ceiling, the various parts can rotate around the internal points; it has three dimensional qualities. With an evolutionary tree, the various lineages can rotate around their nodes just like a hanging mobile.\nThis is very important to recognize. It tells us that when interpreting an evolutionary tree, you should not pay too much attention as to which taxa are next to each other, but rather focus on how taxa are connected by internal nodes. All internal nodes can be rotated without changing the topology. For example, the figure below shows the evolutionary relationship among a subset of mammals. Even though the four trees may look different, they actually are exactly equivalent to one another. This is because it is the order of branching events—the topology—that is relevant, not the order of the taxa at the tips. Each internal node can be rotated without affecting the topology because this does not alter the groupings of species.\nFor example, to convert our original tree (A) to (B), all you need do is rotate around the node labeled as 2. By rotating node 2, elephants (Loxodontia) + armadillos (Dasypus) retain sister taxa with their relationship to the other mammals retained even though they now are found on the “top” of the tree. Likewise to go from tree (B) to (C), simply rotate around node 3, and from (C) to (D), rotate around node 4.\n\n\n\nEvolutionary trees are like mobiles\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nTake a close look at the figure above, and using what you learned above about MRCA defining evolutionary relationship, convince yourself that the four trees above are indeed showing the exact same evolutionary relationship indicated by the branching pattern by tracing the pathways through CA.\n\n\n\n\n5.3.4 Phylogenies may be drawn in many different styles\nSo far the trees shown in the chapter have been very simple in both structure and style. However, that is not always the case. Phylogenies can be simple and straight forward as the ones shown above, or they can be elegant and information rich. It all depends on the information that the author is trying to present and the method used to construct the phylogeny (more on this later).\nThe image below taken from Herron & Freeman (20xx) gives one example of how the same evolutionary relationship can be shown using different styles. Though at first glance one may think the four trees are different, they actually show the same evolutionary relationships among the various extant (not extinct) Felid lineages.\n\n\n\nFour different versions of the same tree modified from Figure 4.5 from Herron and Freeman (20xx)\n\n\nNotice that the trees can be oriented horizontally, vertically, or even as a circle. The internal branch points can be shown as angled or rectangular, or they can stylized as curving (these used to be called “swoopograms”). The key point here is not to be confused by how the tree looks, but focus on the topology itself.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nProve to yourself that these four trees all show the same evolutionary relationships.\n\n\nAnd they can seem even more complicated than just those four. The figure below shows many different styles of trees, yet they all demonstrate the same evolutionary relationship.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nThe following video by JD Laurence-Chasen, a former student of Casey Dunn’s at Brown University, does a great job summarizing many of the issues discussed so far. It is worth checking it out as a way to test how well you understand what we just went over.\n\n\n\n\n5.3.5 Branch lengths on a phylogeny can either have meaning or not, depending on the method used to construct the tree.\nA generalized term for all types of evolutionary trees is a dendogram. When an evolutionary tree is showing only the evolutionary relationships among the various taxa (OTUs), it is referred to as a cladogram. All the trees shown so far in this chapter have been cladograms. Remember, the branch lengths in a cladogram are effectively meaningless. They can be longer or shorter depending basically on esthetics, so long as they do not alter the branching pattern.\nHowever, there are methods used to construct trees that specifically estimate the levels of divergence among taxa. This is most certainly true for molecular and genomic data. We will dive into the specifics of how to estimate an evolutionary tree, particularly using molecular or genomic data, in a later chapter. For our purposes here, when these types of methods are used, the branch lengths on the resulting trees do have meaning; the longer the branch, the larger the level of divergence. The figure below gives a very simple example of how these trees look.\n\n\n\n*From Gregory (2008)*\n\n\nIn this figure:\n\nPanel (a) is a cladogam. Similar to the trees shown earlier in this chapter, the branch lengths have no real meaning. These types of trees are simply showing the branching pattern (topology)or evolutionary relationships among the taxa.\nPanel (b) shows a tree where the branch lengths do have meaning, i.e. they are estimates of the degree of genetic or morphological divergence among taxa. It shows the same evolutionary relationship among taxa as in (a), but includes information on the level of divergence between nodes. This type of tree is often referred to as a phylogram. Phylograms typically include a scale bar some where to indicate how much change is reflected in the lengths of the branches. Total divergence between two taxa is determined on by adding up the length of the branches connecting them: from one species to their CA plus from the CA to the second species. These types of trees are very common in the leterature today since it is pretty much agreed the best data for constructing a reliable evolutionary tree is molecular or genomic data, which naturally lend itself to providing estimates of divergence. Again, more on this later.\nPanel (c) is sort of a modified phylogram called a chronogram. The branch lengths still have meaning, but note that the terminal nodes are aligned with each other and the internal branch lengths are scaled in such a way that the internal nodes are aligned with the estimated date of divergence. This very special type of tree is only used when you can calibrate or convert the levels of divergence into time in some way, say when you have a reliable fossil record for the taxa of interest or are using molecular data that have been calibrated in some way to reliably convert levels of genomic divergence into time. This type of tree is also referred to as ultrametric tree or time-tree. These types of trees are not without controversy, but nonetheless very useful. As an example, take a look at Time Tree of Life website.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDistinguishing among the various types of tree\n\n\n\nCan you tell which type of tree you are looking at just by how they look? Not always, particularly when a lot of creative license was used to make the tree informative. The best way to figure it our is to read the Methods section of the paper, something I strongly recommend you do. However, there are some clues.\n\nCladogram : If terminal taxa are all aligned along the same axis, and the branch lengths lengths seem to have a pattern in terms of different lengths, then you probably have a cladogram. The tree does not need to be rectangular as above, and in fact are often angular, “swoopograms”, or circular trees.\nPhylogram : If the terminal taxa are located at various locations within the figure (not along a single straight axis), the branch lengths are clearly quite different along the tree, and there are either numbers along the branches (usually real numbers) or some sort of scale showing how much divergence is represented by a set distance, then you have a phylogram. These types of trees are usually quite obvious, and can get a little busy owing to the methods used to construct them. Nonetheless, staggered taxa names, probably a phylogram\nChronogram : In this case the terminal taxa will all be aligned along a single axis, but the internal nodes will be distributed along an axis reflecting the estimated date of divergence. In this type of tree, you almost always will see some type of time scale (for example in millions of years, or as a geological time scale) in the same orientation of the tree such that you can trace down to the that scale from any internal node and get an estimate of date of divergence for the lineages splitting off the MCRA. Notice the scale along the bottom of the tree in Panel (c), though it is a little difficult to see in this figure.\n\n\n\n\n\n5.3.6 Trees can be either rooted or unrooted\nAll the evolutionary trees presented in this chapter so far have been rooted trees, meaning that the basal position of the tree has been set giving the tree a temporal directionality. To simplify, a rooted tree can be read as indicating the earliest ancestor at the root or base, from which all other lineages on the tree have descended with the terminal nodes being the most recent: rooted evolutionary trees indicate the passage of time beginning from the root (oldest) to the terminal nodes (youngest). (However, the exact placement of nodes on a rooted tree is not necessarily indicative of the date of divergence unless it is an ultrametric tree.) The following figure shows both a rooted and unrooted tree that have the same branching pattern for the taxa.\n\n\n\nRooted versus unrooted tree\n\n\nTo reiterate, a rooted tree has temporal directionality going from the root to the terminal branches as indicated in the figure. An unrooted tree does not.\nThat there are also unrooted trees may seem a little puzzling at first. There actually are a number of good reasons for why an unrooted tree may be useful, but for our purposes the main reasons why are (a) the methodology used to construct the tree, and (b) that we may not know what would best represent the ancestor leading to the taxa in question.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nDEFINITIONS - a reminder of these two important terms\ningroup - those taxa of interest when estimating a phylogeny.\noutgroup - A taxon or group of taxa that, based on prior evidence or information, is more distantly related to the taxa of interest on a phylogeny. These should be relatives of the ingroup but less closely related to them than the members of the ingroup are to each other.\n\n\nBecause we do not usually know what the ancestor of our ingroup may have looked like, we can use an outgroup to approximate the ancestor since the outgroup and the ingroup form two branches that diverge from a common ancestor, or in this case our putative ancestor.\nDefining and using outgroups used to be a somewhat contentious issue, as with just about everything associated with phylogenetics and cladistics used to be. This more so with morphological than molecular data. Conceptually it is a pretty standard and straight forward process, though you should be cognizant to try to use an appropriate outgroup. How do you know what is an appropriate outgroup? Not an easy question to answer, but generally speaking if you choose a group of taxa that are closely related to the group of taxa that you are trying to determine the evolutionary relationship of (your ingroup), you should be ok. For example, if you are interested in the evolutionary relationship of a group of species within a genus, then using a different genus outside the one of interest that the literature suggests is closely related (e.g. in the same Family), then generally speaking you should be ok. This is not always simple to do, and can be quite challenging with some types of molecular data, e.g. studying the relationship of gene family members. In cases where it is difficult or even inappropriate to include an outgroup, there are other methods for rooting a tree (e.g. mid-point rooting), but be aware they may be controversial in terms of giving the tree a true time directionality.\nHow do we root a tree? The following figure does a very good job explaining the concept of rooting a tree graphically:\n\n\n\nmodified from Bronham (20xx)\n\n\nConceptually to root a tree, you are grabbing the branch connecting the outgroup to the ingroup and pulling the tree up such that the root of the tree, the putative ancestor to both the ingroup and outgroup, marks the base of the tree, as shown in Panel (A). It most definitely can make a difference in terms of where you root your tree, as shown in Panel (B). Note that in the tree on the left in Panel (B), taxa [a+b] form a monophyletic group with taxa c more closely related to [d+e+f] than [a+b], whereas in the right most tree taxa [a+b+c] form a monophyletic group, with c more closely related to [a+b] than it is [d+e+f].\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLanguage of phylogenetics\n\n\n\nNote how I phrased the relationships among various taxa in the above paragraph. It is very important that you become comfortable with the language of phylogenetics (e.g. monophlytic groups, sister taxa, MRCAs) when working with evolutionary trees. It may seem a little cryptic or clunky at first, but trust me, it is the best way to describe evolutionary relationships and prevent confusion or outright mistakes.\n\n\nAs with most everything in phylogenetics today, rooting trees can be easily done using any of the more common phylogenetic analysis programs out there. You basically just click or name your outgroup and the program does it all for you. The underlying algorithms (program steps) behind doing the actual rooting can be a little complex and beyond the scope of this OER, but nonetheless very simple to do.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCaution\n\n\n\nMany programs will produce an initial tree that is either rooted arbritrarily or use mid-point rooting, basically the half way point in the tree. It is then up to you to define the outgroup using whatever the steps the program implements: read the manual to find out.\n\n\n\n\n5.3.7 Phylogenies can be fully resolved…or not\nDepending on the nature of the data and methods being used, most times the trees generated are consistent with how we discussed evolution occurring in previous chapters, divergence from a common ancestor that can be represented by two lineages diverging from a common ancestor (node). We refer to this type of tree as a bifurcating tree. All of the trees we have shown so far have been fully bifurcating trees, or fully resolved trees. This need not always be the case for a number of reasons.\nWhen for whatever reason we can not reliably determine the branching pattern among descendant lineages from a common ancestor, we show this on a phylogeny as more than two branches diverging from a single node, what we refer to as a polytomy. For example, below is a phylogeny of mammals showing a fully bifurcating tree and one with an arbitrary polytomy.\n\n\n\nPhylogeny of some mammals. Topology and branch lengths from http://vertlife.org. The organism silhouettes are from http://phylopic.org/. Note that node circles are not drawn, instead nodes are implied at ends of branches. After Dunn 2024.\n\n\nNote how in the tree on the right we can not determine the relationship among the four taxa (bats, cats, whales, and horses; in reality this relationship is very well resolved).\nThere both soft and hard polytomies. A hard polytomy is when multiple divergence events occurred in very quick succession, giving rise at effectively the same time to more than two lineages (i.e. reflects the “true” evolutionary history). A soft polytomy on the other hand is due to uncertainty about branching order due to other reasons; in other words it is not really a reflection of true evolutionary history of the group. They are usually considered a methodilogical artifact or insufficient data (e.g. not enough data, or the type of data used was inappropriate to resolve the branching pattern). In these cases the polytomies may potentially be resolved by more or a different type of data or a different analytical approach. These type of issues are beyond the scope of this OER, and probably are best left for an advanced course in molecular phylogenetics or phylogenomics.\n\n\n5.3.8 Phylogenies can also be represented by networks\nWhen we think about reconstructing evolutionary histories using phylogenies, we implicitly assume that evolution occurs via the splitting from a common ancestor (cladogenesis) that lends itself well to be represented by a bifurcating phylogenetic tree. However, biological systems being what they are, that is not always the case. For example:\n\nIn some instances lineages may come back together after splitting from an CA, a process called hybrid speciation (we will explore this in more detail when we look at species and the process of speciation).\nPortions of a genome may cross species boundaries for various reasons, a process referred to horizontal gene transfer.\nThe nature of the data itself may not be best represented by a bifurcating process, for example multiple independent mutations occurring in a region of a genome (e.g. alleles at a gene or mitochondrial DNA haplotypes)\nInconsistencies in the patterns of divergence among different regions of the genome.\n\nFor these (and other) reasons, evolutionary relationships are better represented using methods other than bifurcating phylogenetic trees, most notably by what we call networks. Networks can be shown in various ways depending on the nature of the data and the analysis used. Below are a couple of examples of networks.\n\n\n\n\n\nActually, phylogenetic trees themselves are considered a specifc type of network, and certainly it is easy to see that an unrooted phylogenetic tree is most definitely considered a network. Like an unrooted phylogeny, networks have no time directionality associated with them. However, the branch lengths can reflect levels of divergence (but not always), and you can approximate evolutionary relationships via the sharing of MRCA if appropriate.\nBottom line, networks may look different from standard phylogenetic trees, but they still represent the evolution patterns of taxa, and are extremely useful in a number of circumstances. Lately there has been increasing interest in the use of networks due to the increasing advances being made in genomics and the analysis of genomic data, particularly in the emerging field of phylogenomics.\nWe will discuss networks more in the chapter on constructing evolutionary trees.\n\n\n5.3.9 Oftentimes trees are drawn by compressing the number of taxa shown to make them more readable.\nThere are many instances when there is simply too much information to be clearly shown on phylogenetic tree, for example when you have a large number of taxa, so large that the greater point, e.g. higher order relationships, gets lost in forest that is the tree. In that case, it is not uncommon for the authors to collapse clades in the published figure in order to emphasize or summarize the information in clear, succinct manner. Below is an example of compressing the number of taxa on a tree to make it more readable.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe top figure shows in a stylized fashion how collapsing a clade can make the tree a bit more readable. The bottom of the figure shows an example of how collapsing clades help to shift the emphasis of a figure, allowing one to focus on the information that is most important. The tree on the left is a phylogram including all the samples, while the tree on the right collapses the major monophyletic clades to a single branch, making clear the evolutionary relationship of the different species in a genus of damselfish.\nCollapsed clades can be shown in any number of creative ways, usually as triangles. There are numerous programs to help with these types of tree manipulations.\n\n\n5.3.10 Evolutionary trees can contain both extinct (fossil) and extant taxa\nDepending on the evolutionary question being asked, it may be quite useful to include fossil taxa onto a tree should they be available. There are lots of different ways to do this, some more straightforward than others. We will not go much into this at all, but just be aware that methods exist to incorporate both extinct and extant taxa (OTUs) to a tree. Usually we do this using time-trees (ultrametric) with the terminal node of the extinct species set to the estimated date from the fossil record. The figure below provides a very nice example of such a tree.\n\n\n\n\n\nFirst note the time axis along the top of the figure, clearly indicating this a time calibrated tree. Next, notice that the extant taxa (ray finned fish, Coelacanth, Lungfish, and Living tetrapods) are all aligned along a single axis to the far right of the tree, while the branches of the extinct taxa do not. You can get a rough estimate of when a particular extinct taxa split from its common ancestor (for extinct taxa, when they first appear in the fossil record), and for fossil taxa the approximate date of extinction (when it last appears in the fossil record) by simply reading the dates along the time axis that correspond to the internal nodes and the end of the branch for the extinct taxa.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nBased on the information above, you should be able to interpret and understand just about any evolutionary tree we will encounter in this text as well as in the literature. We will dive into how to estimate evolutionary trees later in this OER; it can get a little complicated. Before wrapping this discussion up, there are three more topics worth understanding: (1) mapping characters onto a known phylogeny, in which we will introduce the very important concept of parsimony, (2) some additional information concerning interpreting character states on a tree, and (3) a simple introduction into the uses of phylogenies, which as you will see extends far beyond species relationships.\n\n\n\n\n5.3.11 Mapping characters onto a known phylogeny\nOne the most important uses of evolutionary trees is that they allow us to infer the evolutionary history of particular characters by mapping the characters on the phylogeny. What we mean by mapping is conceptually quite simple: attach or “map” character states (specific traits or behaviors) of existing species to the tree’s branches.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDEFINITIONS\n\n\n\ncharacter - an observable feature or trait on a organism\ncharacter state - one of the variant conditions of a character (e.g. brown coat versus white coat in a species of field mouse)\n\n\nBy simply noting what the character states are in your taxa of interest (terminal nodes), you can then use various methods to:\n\ninfer the history of character evolution\nreconstruct ancestral character states\ndetermine the rate of evolution of character\ntest hypotheses of character evolution using what is known as phylognetic independent contrasts\n\n…among others.\nWhat kind of characters are we talking about? Just about any sort of characteristic that might be of interest. These characters can be molecular (DNA, RNA, proteins), biochemical, physiological, anatomical (both categorical and real), developmental, and even behavioral. I would argue that so long as the character has some genetic basis, just about anything can be mapped on an evolutionary tree, potentially leading to profound insights as to how these characteristics evolved.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCaution\n\n\n\nRemember, what we are discussing here is not building an evolutionary tree, but once you have a reliable tree, how it can provide insights into how evolution works. As we will see later, what we are about to discuss is also relevant to estimating evolutionary trees, but for our purposes here, we are focusing on mapping characters on given tree.\n\n\nBefore going deeper on mapping characters, consider the following logic using the figure below as a reference:\n\n\n\n\n\nTree (A) is an evolutionary tree showing the relationship among 6 OTUs plus an outgroup. Let’s assume that we know that the ancestor as depicted at the root has a circle character state, as shown on the figure. If there are no changes to this character over time, then all the descendants from the root will also have the circle character state, including the internal nodes which represent the (putative) ancestors of the various lineages or groups on the tree.\nNow consider a different scenario. In tree (B), there is a mutation that occurs along one of lineages that converts the circle to a star. That mutation could occur at any time along the branch connecting the two internal nodes, it does not matter (in this example), but the bottom line is that now this internal node (ancestor) has a star character state. Assuming no other mutations occur, all the descendants from this internal node will also have a star character state, forming a monophyletic group.\nThat all should make good sense understanding that evolution occurs via splitting from a common ancestor, as discussed above.\nNow consider if we do not know what the root ancestor’s character state was. All we know is the character states of the OTUs (taxa of interest; tree [C]). Based on the above paragraphs, by inference we would postulate that the reason that all the star taxa have that character state is because they inherited it from a shared common ancestor (tree [D]), a shared MRCA with each other than they do with the circle taxa, a reasonable supposition given our understanding of how evolution works. We show this on the tree by a tick mark along the branch to the MRCA, specifying a gain (mutation) to the star character state.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStar bellied sneeches phylogeny\n\n\n\nThis explains why “the Star-Bell Sneetches had bellies with stars. / The Plain-Belly Sneetches had none upon thars. / Those stars weren’t so big. They were really so small. / You might think such a thing wouldn’t matter at all.” (Seuss)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo formalize the above and help make sense of mapping characters,consider a made up tree consisting of 8 species of mythical small stream fish. These fishes appear to fall into three groups, plain finned, elongated fins, and flowing fins. Assume we have an evolutionary tree that was estimated using molecular data (using one of the techniques we will discuss later in the semester). Using this known tree, we want to study the evolution of fin size and structure in our 8 species, shown in the figure below.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn other words, we wish to determine when a particular character evolved along our known tree. To do this we must first introduce the concept of parsimony. Parsimony is a derivative of Ockham’s Razor, which basically states that when presented with competing explanations or hypotheses for a phenomenon, one should prefer the simplest one that adequately explains the available evidence. In other words, the simplest explanation is probably the best explanation. Of course we know this is not always true, but it makes for a good starting point.\nWith respect to character mapping (or when constructing evolutionary trees for that matter, but more on this later), the most parsimonious explanation for the evolution of a character is probably the best. What we mean by this is the explanation that requires the fewest number of character state changes along a tree is probably the best explanation for the evolution for that character.\nFor example, let’s take a look at the character state “flowing dorsal fin” on the tree above. Using taxa 8 & 7 as our outgroup (assumed a priori when constructing the tree), we can come up with all manner of possible scenarios (hypotheses) as to how “flowing dorsal fin” evolved, some more realistic than others, some more convoluted than others. The figure below gives just four possible scenarios.\n\n\n\nFour possible alternative hypotheses for evolution of flowing dorsal fin\n\n\nRemember everywhere you see a dark tick mark along a branch indicates a character state change. A (+) indicates a gain of the character (that particular character evolved some time along the lineage/branch), and a (-) indicates a loss of the character.\nIn (A), you would interpret the first tick mark on the left as indicating that some time after the splitting of the ingoup and outgroup from the MRCA (root node 9), the character “flowing dorsal fin” evolved, and it did so prior to the node 10, the putative ancestor (also called a hypothetical taxonomic unit, or HTU) to all the fancy-finned fish. Based on this hypothesis, we would infer that the ancestor to all the fancy finned fish had a flowing dorsal fin. If this were true, than in order to explain the distribution of the character “flowing dorsal fin” in the terminal taxa, you need to lose that character some number of times to explain all the lineages that evolved from node 10 (their MRCA) do not have a “flowing dorsal fin”. Tree (A) shows one possible scenario of how that could have happened, specifically there was a loss of “flowing dorsal fin” in the ancestor connecting all the “elongated” species (4, 5, & 6), and independently a loss of “flowing dorsal fin” along the branch leading to species 1 and the branch leading to species 3 in the “flowing” species. Counting up the total number of evolutionary events (the tick marks), we need 4 changes (steps) to account for the distribution of “flowing dorsal fin” in this scenario (tree[A]).\nFollowing the same logic as in tree (A) for other three trees, we see that:\n\nscenario B requires 3 changes\nscenario C requires 2 changes\nscenario D requires only 1 change, the evolution of “flowing dorsal fin” along the lineage leading to species 2\n\nGiven these four scenarios (hypotheses), we would say that scenario (D) was the most parsimonious explanation for the evolution of “flowing dorsal fin” since it requires the fewest number of evolutionary events (changes/steps). It may not be the true explanation, but it certainly is the simplest, and therefore probably the correct one. And you have to agree, it intuitively just makes more sense than complicated alternative scenarios involving multiple independent character gain and loss considering how evolution works.\nUsing the same logic as above, we can map all the fin characters along our known tree, which would look like the following:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nTry going through the logic of character state gain and loss using alternative scenarios as we did above to assure you understand the logic being used here.\n\n\nOnce you have mapped your characters on the tree, you are now in a very strong position to further study the evolution of fin morphology, perhaps leading to greater understanding of the evolution of complex fin morphology in fishes. This is pretty powerful stuff.\nAdmittedly, this is a very simple example, with very simple and clear cut mapping of the characters on a very simple tree. Mapping characters can become much more complicated as the number of taxa and the number of characters increase. Today we rarely would map characters by hand except in the simplest of situations. There are specific programs designed to easily perform character mapping on large data sets incorporating more advanced statistical models than simple parsimony. Nonetheless, the fundamental basis of character mapping remains finding the most parsimonious explanation for the distribution of character along a tree.\n\n\n5.3.12 Some additional information concerning interpreting character states on a tree\nMapping characters on a given phylogeny is very important in evolutionary biology. In fact, many of us would argue that it is one of the most important aspects of understanding evolution; we call it “tree thinking”, and it has been as pivotal in our understanding evolution today as Darwin’s “population thinking” discussed in an earlier chapter. Indeed this whole idea of constructing phylogenies and using that tree as a basis to understand the evolution of characteristics and the process of evolution has become a field by itself referred to as Phylogenetic Biology.\nThe concept of evoking parsimony to understand how characters evolve is also the underlying principal for building phylogenies itself, a topic we will take up later when we discuss the actual methodologies (plural because there are more than a one) of constructing evolutionary trees. However, now is good time to mention a number of essential concepts associated with character mapping and parsimony since we will be using them on and off throughout the semester.\n\n5.3.12.1 Some important definitions and concepts\n\nhomologous character : we discussed what a homologous character is in Section 3.6.\nanalogous character : we also discussed analogous characters in that same section as homologous characters. These are characters that appear to be similar among lineages but not due to shared common ancestry. These types of characters are examples of convergent evolution, where for example similar ecological conditions lead to the same solution to the problem independently in seperate lineages not sharing a MRCA.\napomorphy : a derived character state, one different from the ancestral character state.\nsynapomorphy : a shared derived character state. When a group of lineages all share the same derived character state due to sharing the same MRCA. Synapomorphies define monophyletic lineages\nautapomorphy : a derived character state unique to a singel lineage or single taxa under consideration. Apomorphies are important in defining individual taxa, however since they unique to a lineage, they are considered of no phylogenetic value in terms of helping to determine branching patterns among lineages. We say they are phylogenetically uninformative.\nplesiomorphy : an ancestral character state. They are also called primitive character states by some authors.\nsymplesiomorphy : a plesiomorphic character shared by two or more taxa. Usually they are character states that are shared due to the sharing a deep common ancestor, oftentimes the root ancestor, so they too are not considered phylogenetically informative.\nHomoplasy : a character state shared among independent lineages but not due to shared common descent. In other words, they share this character state not because they inherited it from a MRCA, but becasue it evolved independently in the two lineages. Homoplasies are very important from an evolutionary perspective, as they usually infer some sort of convergent evolution. However, from the perspective of estimating evolutionary trees, they can lead to misidentifying monophyletic clades since they are due to convergent evolution, not the sharing of a MRCA (like a synapomorphy). Homoplasies can also be due to evolutionary reversals, where a character state reverts back to a previous state. These are probably pretty rare in morphological or phenotypic characters (called Dollo’s Law), but probably more common with DNA or protein sequence data since there are a limited number of characters states that can be taken (4 in DNA, 20 in proteins).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nThough terms like sympleisiomorphy, synapomorphy, or homoplasy are kind of impressive sounding, do not let them intimidate you. They may be a little challenging, but actually if you remember the following, it is pretty easy to keep them straight. Just keep in mind what the various parts of the words mean: syn- or sym- means shared or together, apo means away from or changed/derived, plesio means near to or ancient, aut means self or unique, and morphy effectively means character. The figure below puts these all together as a convenient way to learn them.\n\n\n\n\n\nMy personal opinion, if you know what a shared derived character is, I could care less if you call it a “shared derived character” or a synapomorphy. It is more important to me that you are understand what they actually mean.\n\n\nThe following figure is a graphical summary of what is meant by a synapomorphy, symplesiomorphy, autoapomorphy, and homoplasy.\n\n\n\nIn this figure, the circle is the plesiomorphic or ancestral state, the star is the apomorphic or derived state. A tick mark along a branch marks an evolutionary change in the character along that branch.",

    "text": "6.1 Introduction\nIn the previous chapter we learned how to read and interpret phylogenetic trees in general. Phylogenies have historically been inferred by analyzing morphological character matrices using maximum parsimony (the principle of parsimony states that the best phylogeny explains an observed character set with the fewest evolutionary changes). Today, however, the majority of phylogenetic analyses are based on DNA sequence data, because they provide a large number of informative characters. When an alignment varies among taxa, every altered base pair potentially holds useful information about relatedness, and it is much easier to assemble the large data sets needed for phylogenetic inference with DNA sequencing as opposed to the analysis of morphological or other phenotypic traits.\nIn this chapter we will learn the basics of how phylogenies are constructed. We will be focusing primarily on the use of molecular/genomic data since it is pretty much agreed that the most efficient and reliable data for reconstructing evolutionary trees is using molecular data, be it DNA, protein, or even whole genome data. However we will also briefly discuss the use of morphological data since there are many instances in which we might be limited to morphological characters since molecular data is either unavailable or impossible to generate (think fossils here).\nIn the past, constructing evolutionary trees used to be a difficult, tedious, and oftentimes contentious exercise. Though constructing phylogenies is still not particularly easy today, it is infinitely easier than say 15 or 20 years ago. The ready availability and ease of use of increasingly sophisticated and powerful computer programs with GUI front ends combined with stunning computing power available on your desktop has made phylogeny construction almost routine. Almost. There still are a number of very important concepts, issues, and theory we need to understand in order to properly interpret and have faith in your results. Simply clicking a button and getting an answer is powerfully tempting, but it is an empty academic exercise unless you know the whats and whys.\nPhylogenetic theory can be mind-numbingly complex. In order to really dig into this complicated but interesting field would be the place for a dedicated course in phylogenetics or molecular/genomic evolution. For our purposes we will only briefly go over the major concepts so that when you read a paper today in evolution that includes some kind of phylogenetic analysis, you will have a pretty good idea what the authors did and why they did it.",

    "text": "6.2 Types of data used in constructing phylogenies.\n\n6.2.1 Morphological characters\nIn the past, morphological traits were the only type of data available for estimating evolutionary trees. That most certainly is not the case today. Generally speaking, though the use of molecular data is probably the most comon appraoch for constructing phylogenies today, morphological data is still routinely used. This is particularly true when molecular data is unavailable, such as for fossils. It is not uncommon at all to see analyses published that are a combination of both morphological and molecular data, so called supertree analysis. For example, a very detailed study on the relationships of Cetacea among mammals used the supertree approach and included both types of data ( (Spaulding, O’Leary, and Gatesy 2009) ).\nThe methods used in the analysis of morphological characters are the same for both extant and extinct taxa, and usually involve what we refer to as discrete data. Discrete data naturally fall into discrete categories, like the presence of absence of some characteristic, counts (e.g. number of hard rays on a dorsal fin), color or color patterns, etc. These types of data are usually represented in datasets as 1/0 for presence/absence, or integer numbers of counts, or integers (usually 0-9) for the different character states (this is referred to as character coding, which seems like it should be pretty straight forward but in fact can get quite complicated). When integers are used, they usually have no real numerical value associate with them (unless it is count data), but rather simply serve as categories for character states.\nIn contrast, continuous data is when you actually measure or weigh some characteristic, for example body size, growth rates, length, or any other measurable quantitative feature. Continuous character data can be used for phylogenetic analyses, but they require a unique set of models (Brownian motion [BM] or Ornstein-Uhlenbeck [OU] processes, but do not worry about this) and approaches, which we will not be covering here. They most certainly have some advantages, including the preservation of phenotypic variation (you do not have to lose information by converting the character states to discrete values, which can oversimplify complex variation), the models for continuous trait evolution (such as BM and OU) are well-developed and provide robust frameworks for phylogenetic inference, and they may be more easily integrated with molecular.\nUsing continuous characters for constructing phylogenies is relatively uncommon but maturing area for phylogeny construction, and a very active of research in phylogenetic biology.\n\n\n6.2.2 Molecular characters\nIt is generally accepted that molecular/genomic data, in particular DNA sequence data, are the best data to use for reconstructing phylogenies. This opinion was not always the case, and in fact was quite contentious at one time. Except for a few holdovers from outdated arguments, it pretty much is a decided issue today. In addition, the ability to collect large amounts of high quality molecular data is fairly routine today and requires little specific expertise or background in molecular biology. Again, this certainly was not the case in the past. The fundamental methods of PCR, cloning, and library construction, the ready availability of commercial vendors and core facilities for all manner of DNA sequencing techniques, and the streamlining of protocols to go from tissue sample to data sequence file make for the collection of DNA sequence, and to some extent genomic data, infinitely easier than it used to be. It is now fairly routine and readily available for any interested researcher to dive into if they are interested in constructing a phylogeny.\nMolecular data is actually a much broader class of data than just DNA sequence data, though generally speaking DNA data is the most common data today. There is also protein sequence data (which of course can be generated from DNA sequence data), which is much more difficult to generate per se. The methods and chemistry that allow for the automation of DNA sequencing do not exist for the routine and automated sequencing of proteins - at least not yet. This is currently a very active area in research in chemistry and biochemistry with some very promising new technologies poised to become mainstream soon (e.g. Oxford NanoPore protein sequencing).\nOther types of molecular data that were used routinely for phylogenetic analysis in the past include: allozymes, restriction fragment length polymorphisms, AFLPs and the general family of random amplification products, and DNA hybridization. These are pretty much all historical methods rarely used today. See (Schlötterer 2004) for more information on the various molecular markers used over the past couple of decades. Though the data from these various outdated methods can be analyzed using the methods we are about to discuss, we will pretty much just focus on DNA sequence data here.\nDNA, RNA, or protein sequence data falls into the general category of discrete character data, as do most of the other types of molecular data listed above.\nWe will not discuss the actual methodologies of collecting DNA sequence data in this chapter, but will briefly on the chapter on the evolution of DNA sequences. In this chapter we will only be addressing the basics of how to construct evolutionary trees.",

    "text": "6.3 Accurately estimating evolutionary trees\nGenerally speaking, it is easy to construct an evolutionary tree today; it is now kind of point-and-click. The real issue is doing it right. Like playing the saxophone, easy to play, difficult to do it right. Nonetheless, there are a couple of key components associated with constructing a reliable evolutionary tree. Here are just a few:\n\nChoose the type of genomic regions appropriate for your question. There is a lot of variation in the rates of molecular divergence across the genome. Some regions of the genome evolve quite rapidly, while others at a substantially lower rate. For example, protein coding regions (exons) tend to evolve much more slowly than pseudogenes. Likewise there is a large degree of variation among genes themselves in terms of rates of divergence. Some genes are highly conserved and tend to evolve very slowly (e.g. ribosomal 16s and 18s regions), while others evolve quite rapidly (e.g. MHC gene regions and DLOOP in mtDNA). There are groups of genes that have been specifically identified as highly conserved across broad phylogenetic groupings that are now routinely used to estimate deep level phylogenies (ref). Likewise, there are regions of the genome known to evolve so rapidly that they are all but useless for deep level phylogenies and are best used for estimating patterns of kinship among individuals of a population or geographic variation within and among populations within a species.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportant\n\n\n\nThe key is to use genomic regions that are the most appropriate for the question you are asking. Generally speaking, unless you are doing population level phylogenetics, it is best to use characters that change rarely, be those molecular or morphological. Using characters that change infrequently reduces the likelihood of homoplasies caused by reversals. Characters that frequently alternate between states make it difficult to reconstruct an accurate evolutionary history due to an abundance of reversals and associated noise.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nThe trend today is moving away from phylogenies based on specific regions of the genome to using whole genome sequencing (WGS). This is probably the best way to assure you capture the entirety of the phylogenetic signal in the genome. However WGS analysis is whole other creature when it comes to actually estimating the phylogenies and the concepts involved, and is well beyond the scope of this text. We will not spend any time on what is called phylogenomic methods even though it is rapidly becoming the standard for phylogenics today. Instead we will focus on the classical approach based on defined genomic regions.\n\n\n\nKnowledge of Characters and Organisms: Familiarity with the organisms and their traits is incrediby helpful when interpreting the results of a phylogenetic analysis. By understanding the organisms themselves, you can gain valuable insights into the important questions that can be asked, into what your phylogeny is really telling about the evolution of the group or patterns of divergence. This is true for both molecular and morphological data, but certainly more so for morphological data. Sequencing for sequencing’s sake is admittedly interesting in of itself, but knowing your critters makes the science all that much better and rewarding.\nTree Reconstruction Methods and Tools: A solid understanding of various algorithms and criteria used to estimate phylogenetic trees is crucial. Knowing at least the basics of the methods allows researchers to determine which tree best represents the evolutionary relationships given the data used and the assumptions of the tree building methods. This is what we will be spending the remainder of this chapter addressing, the basics of the models and methods to constructing evolutionary trees.",

    "section": "6.4 Overview of analyses",
    "text": "6.4 Overview of analyses\nThe method one uses to estimate evolutionary trees is deeply dependent on the question being asked, the type of data used (the nature of the data: morphological, molecular, or a combination of the two), and the size of the dataset (the number of taxa or OTUs and the number of characters or sequence length). A generalized work flow for the construction of a phylogenetic tree can be seen in the figure below.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 6.1: The construction workflow of a phylogenetic tree. A classic process used to build the evolutionary tree usually contains the following steps: (1) sequence data collection, (2) sequence alignment and trimming, (3) model selection and fitting, as well as (4) tree construction and evaluation. The abbreviations in the figure are as follows: DDBJ, DNA Data Bank of Japan; EMBL, European Molecular Biology Laboratory; NCBI, National Center for Biotechnology Information. From Zou et al. (2024).\n\n\n\n\n6.4.1 Classification of methods\nOne way of organizing the various methods, but probably not the best, is by the data type.\n\nFor morphological data, the primary method is maximum parsimony (MP), along with its various forms (e.g. continuous data methods as mentioned above). We will first look at how MP works in general with a nod toward morphological data before discussing molecular data techniques, though the two are related as you will see.\nFor molecular data, there are two main categories of methods used for phylogenetic tree inference:\n\n(1) Distance-based methods (such as the NJ method and the UPGMA method). These methods first convert the feature matrix into a distance matrix to represent the evolutionary distances between pairs of species, and then combine clustering algorithms to analyze the species under study and infer the phylogenetic tree.\n(2) Character-based methods (such as the parsimony method and the likelihood method). These methods typically generate a large number of hypothetical trees based on an algorithm (such as the MP method and , Maximum Likelihood [ML] method) and then induce an optimal tree according to certain criteria. \n\n\nFocusing mainly on molecular data, and DNA sequence data in particular, the figure below provides a convenient summary of the two approaches mentioned above..\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 6.2: Molecular phylogenetics methods\n\n\n\nWe have already talked about discrete characters above, but what is a “distance data” type? What do we mean by “Tree searching” versus “Clustering algorithm”? To answer these questions, let’s first go over the method of Maximum Parsimony (MP) since it is used for both morphological or molecular data, and understanding how MP will set the groundwork for understanding some very important concepts that we will need later on when discussing some of the other models.\nBut before embarking on our discussion about MP and the other phylogenetic methods, looking back at Figure 6.1 we see that a very important first step, after acquiring your sequence data, is to align your sequences. Multiple sequence alignments (MSA) are an often under-appreciated critical first step in any phylogenetic analysis. Accurate MSAs form the basis for inferring evolutionary relationships, and multiple methods exist that are commonly used to generate consistent results.\n\n\n6.4.2 Multiple Sequence Alignment\nThe starting point of any of the methods discussed in this chapter for molecular data, including MP analysis, is the construction of what is referred to as a Multiple Sequence Alignment (MSA) file. MSA is the computational process of aligning three or more biological sequences (DNA, RNA, or protein) to identify regions of similarity and differences among them. You can think of it as a way of determining position homology among your sequences.\nWhy would you need to do this? Obviously, whether morphological or molecular data, you want to use homologous characters for your analysis. With morphological data this is relatively straight forward to some degree. With molecular data you will be dealing with DNA sequence data that is either downloaded from online databases (like NCBI GenBank) or raw data files derived from sequencing. Either way you want to be sure that (a) homologous regions of the genome (e.g. gene regions) are being compared across the samples, and (b) that homologous nucleotide positions for each gene region are aligned among the samples so you are comparing the same positions from the same genes. This is basically what a MSA program does. Programs that perform MSA arrange DNA sequence data by similarity, matching up homologous nucleotides across samples. Aligned sequences are arranged in a matrix, where sequences from different samples are organized in rows and homologous nucleotides in columns. As an example, the figure below shows an image of an unprocessed data file that is not aligned, while the figure on the right is the results of an MSA on the same data.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe figure on the left is of a FASTA file of mtDNA sequence data collected using PCR direct seqeuncing from a group of damselfish in the genus Abudefduf. A fasta file is standard data format used in DNA sequence data. Note that some of the sequences do not start with the same sequence. The image to the right is a MSA of the same data algined using the program MUSCLE.\n\n\n\nConstructing MSAs operationally is quite easy today due to the ready availability of user friendly programs, but it is not a trivial exercise by any means. Almost all of the various methods weigh the differences found among sequences taking into consideration the types of nucleotide (or amino acid) differences, as well as insertions and deletions. Some also take into consideration structural characteristics and other properties associated with the genomic region being considered.\nThe technical details of the various alogorithms used in constructing a MSA are far beyond this text. You can get a sense of the complexity of MSA from this Wikipaedia entry. Rather than getting too lost in the weeds of this complex and not without controversy topic, let’s just leave it that there are numerous approaches to constructing a MSA with various approaches and and philosophical underpinnings. It is my experience that most researchers today pay little attention to the algorithm they use or its assumptions for making a MSA, and simply fall back on the industry favorites with default options.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSome widely used program for performing a MSA\n\n\n\nBelow is a list of some of the most widely used programs for performing multiple sequence alignment:\n1. Clustal Omega: A progressive alignment tool known for its speed and scalability, suitable for large datasets.\n1. MUSCLE: Provides high accuracy and speed, often used for protein and nucleotide alignments.\n1. MAFFT: A progressive-iterative alignment tool that supports large-scale alignments with high accuracy.\n1. Mauve: Designed for aligning whole genomes, especially useful for microbial genomes.\n\n\nImplementations of these programs can be easily found online for download to run on your desktop, in online web apps (for example, EMBL Explore Sequence Analysis Tools has instances of most of these program available for free), or as part of GUI packages like Unipro UGENE or MEGA. Both these GUI apps are free, tend to be incredibly easy to use, and perform most of what we will be discussing in this chapter.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportant\n\n\n\nOnce you have produced a MSA of your data, you are not done yet. Best practices dictate that you should take a close look at the resulting MSA to make sure the program worked correctly and to QC the results. Pretty much all the programs mentioned above have options for manually editing a MSA, so take advantage of them. Carefully review your alignment to see if there are regions that may require manual editing, fine tuning, or trimming. Do not just accept what the program gives you. Insufficient editing/trimming may introduce incorrect or noisy alignments, which can lead to all sorts of problems with the downstream analyses.\nOnce aligned, trimmed, and edited, the aligned DNA or protein sequences can be used for any of the methods discussed here, as well as to identify variants that can be useful for many population genetic analyses.\n\n\nWe will talk a little about the data formats for aligned sequence data in lab. Generally speaking it depends on the specific programs you will using. The standards are called nexus formatted files or aligned FASTA files. GUI programs like MEGA often use their own formats, but have options for importing or exporting data in various other formats.\nOnce the MSA is completed, the next steps are to determine the appropriate algorithms for phylogenetic tree inference.",

    "section": "6.5 Maximum parsimony (morphological and molecular data)",
    "text": "6.5 Maximum parsimony (morphological and molecular data)\nRecall from the previous chapter our use of the concept of parsimony as it pertained to mapping characters on a phylogenetic tree: that the most parsimonious explanation for the evolution of a character on a phylogeny was the one that required the fewest number of evolutionary events (changes/steps). We can take this same thread of logic now and apply it to estimating a phylogeny given a set of characters, be they morphological or molecular: among the various phylogenetic trees that can be imagined for a group of taxa, the best estimate of the true phylogeny is the one that requires us to postulate the fewest number of evolutionary changes.\nRephrasing the above, we can describe maximum parsimony as follows: find the tree that minimizes the total amount of evolution required to create the tree, i.e. the fewest number of evolutionary changes. That sounds fairly straight forward, but let’s clarify it a little. What we have to begin with is a dataset that consists of the value of the character for each taxa (OTU) under consideration. Think of it as a spreadsheet with taxa names defining the rows, and character scoring for each of the homologous characters as columns (for example, the table on the lower right of Figure 6.3).\nThe formatted data file we use for many of the programs to perform a parsimony analysis look a lot different from our imaginary spreadsheet, though there are some programs that will actually take a spreadsheet-like data file (called a “.csv” file). There are standardized data formats that most programs will accept, the most popular for morphological data being the “nexus” format. If you are interested, you can find information on the nexus file format here. To see what an actual working nexus file looks like, you can find one here. Again, depending on the program you use, aligned molecular data can be in nexus format as well for MP analysis.\nGiven a set of characters, be they morphological characters or aligned DNA sequences, parsimony analysis works by determining the fit (number of steps or changes) of each character on a given tree by mapping the character on the tree evoking parsimony. If we do that for all the characters in our dataset, we can then sum the total number of changes for all the characters mapped on that tree. This will give us a value called the tree Length. If we repeat this same process for a bunch of different trees with different topologies, then we would end up with a estimate of the tree length for each of the trees. The most parsimonious tree is the one that requires the fewest number of changes, or reworded has the smallest or minimum tree length needed to explain the observed distributions of all the characters. We have used the criterium of Maximum Parsimony to choose the best tree (shortest tree) from a group of possible candidate trees.\nThe slide below taken from Futuyma and Fitzpatrick (2017) will help clarify the process:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 6.3: from Futuyma and Fitzpatrick\n\n\n\nIn this figure taken from the course slide deck, there are three possible trees we are assessing for a molecular dataset that includes 5 taxa and 7 characters (aligned sequences from a region of the genomes). We take each character one at a time and map the changes along each of the 3 possible trees, evoking parsimony each time to determine the character state changes along the tree. After mapping all 7 characters, we sum the total number of changes (tick marks in this instance) along each tree to calculate the tree length. The tree with the shortest tree length (total number of changes) is then considered our best guess for the tree describing this dataset evoking maximum parsimony. In this specific case we would choose Tree 1 as our most parsimonious tree since it had the smallest tree length (total number of changes) along the tree.\nBy way of another example only now using morphological characters:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 6.4: from Futuyma and Fitzpatrick\n\n\n\nIn this example we are assessing only two different trees, mapping the morphological characters onto the tree as we did with the molecular data evoking parsimony. Once again, when we look at the tree lengths for the two trees, we find that tree B, the accepted phylogeny, requires only 10 steps, while tree A, the hypothetical tree, requires 14 steps. We would then accept tree B as the most parsimonious tree based on the data set.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportant\n\n\n\nTo reiterate, in maximum parsimony, among the various phylogenetic trees that can be imagined for a group of taxa, the best estimate of the true phylogeny is the one that requires us to postulate the fewest number of evolutionary changes.\n\n\nThe above two examples are pretty simple and straightforward, and with so few characters and taxa, easy to do by hand. In reality the datasets used are much larger and complicated, and you would never try to do them by hand. There are lots of programs out there to do the parsimony mapping for you, as well as numerous other options. More on this later.\nTwo points before moving on. It turns out (not by coincidence) that the best tree defined by maximum parsimony has two important consequences:\n1. Maximizes number of shared derived characters (synapomorphies), the basis of defining monophyletic groups)\n2. Minimizes number of homoplasies\nRecall from the previous chapter that homoplasies reflect shared character states not due to common ancestry. We most certainly want to down-weigh those when considering the best tree since they will cause confusion as to patterns of descent. However, this is not to down-weigh the importance of homoplasies. Since they are often due to convergent evolution or reversal, they can be exceptionally interesting to study.\nLikewise it is very good that we are maximizing the number of synapomorphies as these are the characters that define monophyletic groupings. So a maximum parsimony tree potentially maximizes the number of monophyletic groups.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportant\n\n\n\nTo summarize the above, for maximum parsimony we take the following steps:\n\nmap character states for the various characters on a group of trees evoking parsimony\ncount the total number of character state changes along the various trees (tree length)\nthe shortest tree is probably the correct tree\n\nWe use this same logic for either morphological characters or DNA/protein sequences.\n\n\n\n6.5.1 Choosing trees\nThough the above hopefully makes good sense, you probably are asking yourself “how do we find a tree, or a bunch of trees, that we can then map our characters on to determine the best tree?” There are a couple of approaches one can take. You might have a couple of a priori hypotheses you wish to assess, as we did with Figure 6.4 where we were evaluating only two alternative hypotheses. This is all well and good, but does not guarantee that either of these trees are actually the shortest of all possible relationships. There may be another tree out there in tree land that might be shorter than either of these two, and therefore a better representation of the relationships.\nWhat if we have no a priori hypotheses, then how do we choose which trees to evaluate? Conceptually, the answer seems simple: evaluate all possible trees showing all possible relationships of the taxa. The problem here is the total number of possible trees for a set number of taxa, or in other words number of alternative hypotheses (i.e., alternative tree configurations). The number of possible phylogenetic trees grows unimaginably large for even moderately sized data sets. For a data set with \\(n\\) taxa, the total number of possible (unrooted) trees is:\n\\[\n\\prod_{i=1}^{n}(2i-5)\n\\]\nFor example, the figure below is a table showing the possible number of unique trees for just a small number of taxa.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 6.5\n\n\n\nNotice that the figure includes both rooted and unrooted trees. Considering just the rooted trees, for 4 taxa we see there are 15 possible unique trees demonstrating the relationship among the taxa. That would be a lot of trees to map characters on if doing it by hand (which you would never do). Four taxa is a very simple dataset, no where near what modern study would look like. The problem gets even worse when we look at more reasonably sized datasets in terms of number of taxa. The table below shows just that.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 6.6\n\n\n\nEven for a moderate number of taxa, the total number of unique trees is impossibly large to assess each and every one. For just 20 taxa, there are more possible tree configurations than human cells (that is, all cells from all humans). The number of possible trees eclipses the number of atoms in the universe at just over 50 taxa. Clearly this idea of testing all possible trees is untenable, and we need an alternative strategy.\nTo formalize, to find the most parsimonious tree for a given dataset, there are three generalized methods:\n\nExhaustive Search: This involves generating and comparing all possible trees. However, this approach becomes computationally unfeasible as the number of taxa increases, and all but impossible for just 20 taxa or more where the number of possible trees approaches astronomical figures.\nBranch and bound: This is an alternative to an exhaustive search that is not really worth going into since it is computationally intensive and unfeasible as the number of taxa increases, generally getting you no more ahead of the game as an exhaustive search.\nHeuristic Search (Algorithms): These are a group of approximate methods to search for the shortest tree. These algorithms iteratively refine trees to improve their accuracy. Starting with a basic starting tree, branches are rearranged and swapped in a systematic way, and criteria are used to evaluate whether the new tree is better than the previous. If an improvement is found, the changes (the new tree) are kept; otherwise, you retain the previous tree. You then continue the cycle of rearranging and swapping branches on trees and comparing them to best tree from the previous cycle until it becomes difficult to find a better tree than the one you are holding on to, or you just give up.\n\nWe will not go into any of the details around how exactly heuristic searches are performed, but obviously you let a computer do all this. Heuristic searches tend to do a reasonable job of finding the shortest or near shortest tree, or at least that is what theory and experimental phyogenetics tells us. The available programs for performing maximum parsimony analysis usually come with numerous options for performing various flavors of heuristic searches, and you should refer to their manuals before using them to determine what is your best strategy and options.\nLet’s formalize this logic into something akin to a roadmap to a computer program (algorithm) to perform parsimony analysis.\n\n\n\nListing 6.1: MP analysis\n\n\n1. guess at a tree\n2. evaluate the tree by mapping character state changes along branches of tree, evoking parsimony;\n3. calculate the total tree length (call that value *X*)\n4. take another tree, or make alternative guess (hypothesis) at how the tree might look\n5. evaluate this tree as in steps 2 and 3 (call that vaue *Y*)\n6. compare the two trees by comparing *X* to *Y*\n7. accept the shortest tree as better approximation of the two (parsimony); keep that tree and throw out the other\n8. repeat steps 3 – 7 for some defined number of trees until you run out of trees, are convinced you have found the shortest tree (most parsimonious tree), or are just tired of searching\n\n\n\nThe end result of these steps will be a tree or group of trees that will be our best estimate of the relationship among the taxa based on maximum parsimony.\nA couple of closing points on maximum parsimony before moving on.\n\nEqually parsimonious trees : It is entirely possible and not at all uncommon that using a heuristic search will result in not one but multiple trees of equal total length. We refer to these trees as equally parsimonious. Since they are equally parsimonious, we have no way of determining which is a better representation of our given dataset. To deal with these, we have a series methods to produce what is called a consensus tree. This is exactly as it sounds, it is a consensus of all the equally most parsimonious trees. There are different types of consensus criteria, though the one you are probably most familiar with would be “majority rules” consensus. Most programs the perform MP give options for different consensus criteria. Regardless, the end result is a tree that contains polytomies for the unresolved nature of the equally parsimonious trees. Polytomies may not be desirable, but if that is what the data says, it is what is says. There are recommendations for trying to resolve polytomies, but this usually involves reanalyzing your dataset using some other model, or collecting more data.\nThere are different flavors of parsimony out there, none of which are really worth our time to go over for this class. One worth mentioning though is called Weighted Parsimony. In Weighted Parsimony, you a prioir assign numerical weights to the various characters and/or type of changes (character states) for those characters. When determining the tree length, the values being summed are not just changes on the tree, but weighted changes (e.g. change times the weight assigned). For example, with molecular data, when looking at a protein coding region of a genome, you might want to assign different weighting factors to first, second, and third codon positions since we know that the three codon positions tend to evolve at different rates. Or you might want to weight transitions differently than transversions, or one gene region more than another in your dataset. It is a little more difficult to assign weights to morphological characters, but it certainly is justifiable. By taking a weighted parsimony approach, you are inherently using a (potentially) more realistic model of character state changes, which can result in more accurate results in terms of finding the shortest tree. And again, you do all this using options in the software you are using.\n\nWe discussed MP with respect to both morphological and molecular data, but today it seems that MP is rarely used for molecular data to estimate phylogenies. Due to the nature of DNA sequence data and the increasing size of most datasets today, MP is not the preferred or most efficient way to estimate phylogenies. Today the recommended best practices for constructing evolutionary trees is using either distance based, maximum likelihood, or Baysian analyses, which is where we will be going next.",

    "text": "6.6 Distance based methods\nReturning back to Figure 6.2, the next method to discuss is what we refer to as distance-based methods, which include both clustering and tree search methods. These methods are best suited over MP for molecular data for a number of reasons, and though they can also be used for morphological data using the appropriate models for constructing the distance matrix, it is strongly recommended against. The resulting trees from morphological data may not be a reflection of evolutionary relationships as much as just morphological similarity (and therefore not necessarily distinguishing between synapomorphies and homoplasies). Though the patterns of morphological similarity may be interesting and useful to study, we are interested in reconstructing evolutionary relationships.\nThe fundamental steps in estimating an evolutionary tree using distance based methods, focusing first on the clustering methods, can be summarized as follows.\n1. perform a multiple sequence alignment (MSA) of your data\n2. calculate a pair-wise distance among taxa using a specified model of sequence evolution\n3. use an algorithm to cluster taxa by overall similarity/distance into groups of more similar taxa\n4. goal: minimize the total distance among all taxa, *i.e.* total length of the tree\nGenerally speaking, distance methods group species based on genetic similarity, with similar species clustering closely together on a phylogenetic tree and dissimilar species being separated by longer branches. In phylogenetics, the degree of genetic similarity is often called the phylogenetic distance, which is the number of nucleotide (or amino acid) differences between two species. To infer phylogenetic trees, pair-wise phylogenetic distances are first calculated among all species in a data set, yielding a phylogenetic distance matrix. The distance matrix can then be converted into a bifurcating tree with various algorithms.\n\n6.6.1 Estimating phylogenetic distance\nOnce you have a MSA of your sequence data, the next step is to calculate a pairwise distance among the taxa using an appropriate model of DNA evolution. (NOTE: we can easily use protein sequence as well, but for brevity’s sake let’s just focus on DNA sequence for the time being.) A DNA pairwise distance is a quantitative measure of the genetic difference between two DNA sequences. It is typically expressed as the proportion of nucleotide sites at which the sequences differ, or as the number of substitutions per site. You are effectively comparing the level of sequence divergence between all possible pairs of taxa in your dataset.\nWhat is meant by an appropriate model of DNA evolution? Like most things in molecular phylogenetics, this can get a little complicated. However, it is worth taking the time to understand the fundamental basis of DNA substitution models since they play a very important role in constructing evolutionary trees as well as understanding rates and patterns in DNA and protein evolution.\nBefore exploring the various models of sequence evolution, it will be helpful to briefly discuss a couple aspects of DNA substitution patterns and evolution that will help make sense of why we have different models of DNA evolution.\n\n6.6.1.1 Multiple substitutions\nBecause there are only 4 different nucleotides (A, G, C, & T), as two sequences diverge over time due to the independent accumulation of mutations, it is unavoidable that there would be multiple substitutions that may occur at the same site. The figure below shows some of these possible multiple substitution events.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSix kinds of nuceotide substitutions. In each case the ancestral nucleotide was A. In all except the case of a single substituiton, the number of substitutions that actually occurred is greater than would be counted if we just compared the two descent sequences. I the lover three cases the nucelotides are identical in both descendant sequences, but this similarity has not been directly inherited from the ancestral sequence, leading to a homoplasy. From Page & Holmes (1998).\n\n\n\nThe end result of multiple substitutions is that over time there will be a tendency for the relationship between sequence divergence versus time will begin deviating from linear, eventually plateauing out such that you can no longer estimate how long two sequences have diverged from each other. We can see this in the figure below.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 6.7: Plots of Time since divergence versus sequence divergence. In the left figure, divergence asymptotes at some level due to the effects of multiple substitutions. This lack of linearity of observed divergence versus time (expected divergence) can be problematical since after the inflection point of the curve level of sequence divergence will become unrealible and not reflect the time from divergence. To correct for this, as shown in the right figure, various models of sequence evolution are used.\n\n\n\n\n\n6.6.1.2 Differences in rates of transitions and transversions\nRecall from your basic genetics course that the four DNA nucleotide bases (A, G, C, & T) fall into two categories based on their chemical structure: purines (G & A) and pyrimidines (C & T). We classify substitutions (mutations) within and among these two groups as transitions (mutation from a purine to a purine, or from a pyrimidine to a pyrimidine) and transversions (going from the purine to a pyrimidine, and vice versa). A clean way to visualize these can be found in the following figure.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 6.8: Different rates of substitutions among nucleotide bases. Notice that for each mutation pathway, there is potentially a unique rate of substitution designate Pii. The diagonal rates are not show in this figure\n\n\n\nAccording to this figure, we should expect to find twice as many possible transversions than transition (8 vs. 4) if mutation is random. However, this is not the case; generally we find transitions appear to outnumber transversions in real data. We have a pretty good why this is the case, but the explanation lies beyond the scope of this text. The important message here is that there is a transition-transversion bias that we need to take into consideration as well to accurately model patterns of DNA evolution.\nIn addition, the data also suggests that rates of transitions more quickly begin plateau out over time due to multiple hits compared to transversions.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 6.9\n\n\n\nFor these reasons, any model of DNA evolution should take into considerations the number of transitional and tranversional changes between OTUs.\n\n\n6.6.1.3 Rates of change among nucleotides can vary\nNot only is Figure 6.8 is a good heuristic for visualizing transitions and transversions, it provides a road map to begin modeling substitution rates among the various nucleotides. Figure 6.8 does not suggest that there are any differences among the substitution rates (e.g \\(P_{AG}\\) compared to \\(P_{GA}\\)), but obviously that could be the case. We can represent these rates of substitutions as a matrix that can then be used in various maths (matrix algebra) to analyze various models that accounts for differing rates in nucleotide substitutions (Figure 6.10).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 6.10: Substitution matrix of all possible nucleotide substitutions. The vector below \\(f\\) is the frequency of the difference nucleotides.\n\n\n\nThe matrix shown in Figure 6.10 is incredibly useful as it allows us to vary any of the rates of nucleotide substitution in an effort to more accurately model DNA evolution. We will come back to this figure as warranted as we now begin discussing the various models of DNA evolution and what they correct for, starting with the simplest and moving on to increasingly complicated models with lots of parameters (a parameter might be for example different rates for transitions versus transversions, or differences in frequencies of the four nucleotides).\n\n\n\n6.6.2 The models\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportant 6.1: Various models of DNA sequence evolution\n\n\n\n\nPercent divergence (p; Section 6.6.2.1)\nJukes-Cantor (JC; Section 6.6.2.2)\nKimura’s 2 Parameter (K2P; Section 6.6.2.3)\nFelsenstein 1981 (F81; Section 6.6.2.4)\nHasegawa, Kishino, and Yano (HKY85; Section 6.6.2.5)\nGeneral Time Reversible Model (GTR; Section 6.6.2.6)\n\n\n\nWithout going into too much detail, below we will very briefly discuss some the more useful models you will find in the literature. We will avoid just about all the theory and equations, but understanding the various models and what they correct for will be helpful to understand the whats and whys when reading papers.\n\n6.6.2.1 Percent divergence\nThe simplest estimate of pairwise divergence between two sequence is the percent sequence divergence \\(p\\). This is simply taking the total number of nucleotide positions that differ between two sequences divided by the total number of nucleotide sites compared. It is a simple percentage, uncorrected, and at first blush makes good sense. However, we know quite a lot about how DNA evolves over time, and it turns out simply calculating the percent sequence divergence can be quite problematical. One primary reason is multiple substitution problem referred to above which results in a nonlinear relationship between time and sequence divergence. For that reason alone \\(p\\) should really only be used for very closely related sequences, for example from within a population.\n\n\n6.6.2.2 Jukes-Cantor (JC)\nThe JC model is one of the simplest models. It is referred to as a single parameter model since it effectively makes a single correction, for multiple substitutions. It assumes all substitutions are equally likely, all nucleotides occur at same frequency, and has a single parameter - the rate of substitution (\\(\\alpha\\)). I promise, this will be one of the few where we will show the equation and the substitution matrix, just so you can get a sense of how we use the matrices when calculating the level of divergence.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 6.11: The equation for calculating JC is given above, where \\(p\\) is the precent divergence. The matrix \\(P_i\\) is the substitution matrix similar to (SubstMatrix?). \\(f\\) is the vector of nucleotide frequences, which are all equal in the JC model, and the heuristic for the various substitution rates is similar to Figure 6.8\n\n\n\n\n\n6.6.2.3 Kimura’s 2 Parameter (K2P)\nThe JC model corrects for multiple hits, but unfortunately is not the able to correct for some of the other known biases that can lead to non-linearity. For that we need more complex models estimating other parameters to correct for know biases. The K2P model was proposed to account for the transition-transversion bias previously discussed. It does so by adding parameters to account for the difference between transitions (\\(\\alpha\\)) and transversions (\\(\\beta\\)), and assumes that the nucleotides occur in equal frequencies\nI know, I promised we would not show the equations or matrices involved, but just one more. After this, you should have a good sense how this all works.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 6.12: The equation for calculating Kimura’s 2 parameter model is given above, where \\(P\\) is the proportion of transition differences, \\(Q\\) is the proportion of transversion differences, and the matrix \\(P_i\\) is the substitution matrix similar to (SubstMatrix?). \\(f\\) is the vector of nucleotide frequences, which are equal, and the heuristic for the various substitution rates is similar to Figure 6.8\n\n\n\n\n\n6.6.2.4 Felsenstein 1981 (F81)\nThe F81 model was also proposed around the same time as K2P. It attemoted to address a known bias caused by unequal frequencies of nucleotides. It assumes the rate of transitions equal transversions similar to the JC model. The model allows for different frequencies of nucleotides by having different rates in the \\(f\\) vector such that \\(f=[\\pi_A \\; \\pi_C \\; \\pi_G \\; \\pi_T]\\).\n\n\n6.6.2.5 Hasegawa, Kishino, and Yano 1985 (HKY85)\nThis model is sort of a hybrid of the K2P and F81 since it accounts for different rates of transitions (\\(\\alpha\\)) and transversions (\\(\\beta\\)) as well as unequal nucleotide frequencies \\(f=[\\pi_A \\; \\pi_C \\; \\pi_G \\; \\pi_T]\\).\n\n\n6.6.2.6 General Time Reversible Model (GTR)\nThe GTR model is similar to the HKY85 model except that it allows different rates of substitutions between the various nucleotides such that you do have a total six different substitution parameters, one for each of the possible pathways of substitution for the different nucleotides. For example, looking at (SubstMatrix?), \\(P_{AG} = P_{GA}\\) and \\(P_{CT} = P_{TA}\\); there are 4 parameters for the transversion changes, 2 for the transition changes. Unequal frequency of nucleotides are also corrected for.\n\n\n6.6.2.7 Parameter rich GTR\nThis version of the GTR model has a total of 12 paramters, one for each path between nucleotides in both directions. For example, looking at (SubstMatrix?), \\(P_{AG} \\neq P_{GA}\\) and \\(P_{CT} \\neq P_{TA}\\).\nThe figure below sumarizes these 5 different models and what they account for.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 6.13: Interrelationships among the five models for estimating the number of nucleotide substitutions among a pair of DNA sequences. The JC, K2P, F81, and HKY85 models can all be generated by constraining various parameters of the REV model. From Page and Holmes (1989).\n\n\n\nThere are other models that are also routinely used as well. For example, the help files in MEGA is a convenient resource for describing the above models as well as some others. Wikipaedia has a pretty thorough entry for Models of DNA evolution you can also check out.\n\n\n6.6.2.8 Additional corrections\nAll the above models have the following inherent assumptions:\n\nAll nucleotide sites change independently\nSubstitution rates are constant over time and in different lineages\nBase composition is in equilibrium\nThe conditional probabilities of nucleotide substitutions are the same for all sites and do not change over time\n\nThese assumptions do not always hold, so it should not be surprising that other correction factors have been developed to try to make the models more realistic. A couple of these corrections are:\n\nVariation in substitution rates. We will hopefully get to discuss this a little more in the chapter on molecular and genomic evolution, but for now, we find different rates of substitution across the genome, and should try to account for these. Some genes evolve faster that others. Some genomic regions evolve faster than others (e.g. third position exon sites have much slower rates of substitutions than do introns or pseudogenes). Without going in to any details, the correction for rate variation is estimated by what is referred to as a gamma shape parameter termed \\(\\alpha\\). Low \\(\\alpha\\) corresponds to a large rate variation; as \\(\\alpha\\) gets larger, the range of rate variation diminishes. There are ways to estimate the parameter \\(\\alpha\\) given the data, and most programs will allow the option to include the gamma correction. When this correction is used, you will usually see the authors make reference to using e.g. the GTR+\\(\\Gamma\\) model, meaning these used the General Time Reversible model correcting for variation in substitution rates.\nThe proportion of invariant sites, i.e. the percent of nucleotide sites that are free to vary, can very much impact the difference between observed levels of divergence and divergence time. The higher the percentage of nucleotide sites free to vary, the closer the relationship gets to linearity (that correction zone shown in Figure 6.7). Most program will allow for this corrections as well.\nCodon position. The last model correction we will mention is not really a correction per se, but a modification of the K2P model specifically used for protein coding regions where you can identify the codon position where a substitution occurs. Again we will not go into any of the details, but this is a very useful model for protein coding regions since it allows for distiguishing between rates of synonymous (do not result in an amino acid change) versus nonsynonymous (results in an amino acid change) substitutions. There are a couple of different models to take substitution types into consideration, one of the most common is the Li-Wu-Luo method (for more information on this model, see the following link to the MEGA help files).\n\nAt this juncture you may be asking yourself why we have so many different models, why not just use the model that corrects for all the know biases (e.g. the parameter rich GTR+\\(\\Gamma\\) correcting for invariant sites), and if not that how do I choose what model to use? What about protein sequence data?\n\nWhy we have so many different models? I think we already went over this one, to correct for the various known biases associated with DNA sequence data. Really though, it reflects a progression of more complex models being developed over time as molecular evolution theory advanced. The JC model was derived in the late 60s, with the increasingly more complicated models beibg developed throughout the 70s and 80s. So it is a historical thing.\nWhy not just use the most complex model that corrects for everything? That is a good question, and the answer lies in the number of parameters that need to be estimated. All these rates, frequencies, distributions, etc have to be estimated from the data set itself. Though we have some idea of the range of values we would expect for the various parameters, the actual values are very much dataset dependent, with parameter estimates influenced by the number and type of taxa, the genomic regions used, and number of basepairs sequenced. There is a tradeoff between the reliability of the estimated parameter values and the number of parameters that need to be estimated. For any given dataset, the more parameters, the less confidence we can place on the estimated values; you sacrifice accuracy in terms of parameter estimation as you increase the number of parameters estimated. If you have a lot of parameters (like say 14+ parameters from the “parameter rich GTR+\\(\\Gamma\\) correcting for invariant sites” model), you may have a model that could potentially best fit the data, but the parameter estimates are not very reliable. So the goal is to try to use the least complex model with the fewest number of parameters you can without sacrificing model accuracy.\nHow do I choose what model to use? : It used to be you just tried a few to see what happens. Now there are a number of programs that can help choose the best model for a dataset in a systematic way. We will not go into these at all other than to mention one of the most popular apps, jModelTest2 (Darriba et al. (2012)). It is pretty much state of the art as of 2025, and is included in many of the GUI based molecular phylogenetic packages.\nWhat about protein sequence data? : Yes, their models for analyzing protein sequence as well that follow the same sort of philosophy, but are quite different. These are beyond the scope of this text, and are more appropraite for a molecular evolution course (which I no longer get to teach at Wheaton).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCaution\n\n\n\nAt this point you may also be curious as to whether there are methods for calculated pairwise distance matrices from morphological data? The answer is most definitely, but the distance measures (i.e. the models) are completely different. In addition, it is not recommended that you use morphological data for these type of distance matrix/clustering methods to estimate evolutionary relationships. Yes, you can get a very nice tree, but theory argues the resulting are not optimal for estimating phylogenies for reasons I really do not want to go into (HINT: think about homoplasies). You can analyze morphological data this way, just do not call the resulting trees phylogenies.\n\n\nThe end result of calculating a pair-wise distance matrix is exactly what it sounds like, a matrix, usually the lower right diagonal, containing all possible pair-wise estimates of phylogenetic distance based on the evolutionary model used. Below is an example of a distance matrix in case you are not familiar with them.\n\nNote that the above is a convenient representation of the distance matrix, making it easy for humans to interpret. Many programs use different formats to store and work with the distance matrix, but almost always have an option to view it like above. The diagonal elements of the matrix is the sample compared to itself, and is usually empty. The lower keft off diagonal elements are then the pair-wise distances. The upper right diagonal is usually left empty as well, but if we did include the values they would be a mirror image of the lower left diagonal.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nAs a reminder of where we are at. Refering back to (phylowork?), we discussed the first step in estimating a phylogeny (after generating your data) was constructing a multiple sequence alignment (MSA). This MSA was then analyzed to construct a pairwise phylogenetic distance matrix using one of the DNA evolution models just discussed (if you were very careful, you would have used jModelTest2 to figure out which model was the best one to use for your data).\n\n\nOnce you have calculated the distance matrix, the next step in this group of methods would be to calculate the evolutionary tree using a clustering algorithm.\n\n\n\n6.6.3 Clustering algorithms\nClustering algorithms are programs that take the pair-wise distance matrix and based on a set algorithm estimate an evolutionary tree that best reflects the data. The difference between clustering algorithm and other tree estimation algorithms like MP or Minimum Evolution (ME) is that the clustering algorithm will always result in a single tree being returned. The same tree will always be output regardless how often you run the program on the same dataset. This most definitely is not the case of other tree estimate strategies, but we will get to them. There are many different clustering algorithms that have their pros and cons. The two most common methods are called UPGMA (Unwighted Pair Group Mean Average) and Neighbor Joining (NJ).\nNote that the actual math behind these algorithms goes beyond the scope of this text, but if you are interested, there are plenty of sources out there, texts, YouTube videos, and even wiki entries for the different approaches (neighbor-joining methods, UPGMA, and WPGMA). A really good explanation of how UPGMA works can be found here. A decent YouTube video for NJ can be found here.\nFor this type of analysis, NJ appears to be the preferred method for a couple of reasons:\n\nyields a unique tree\ndoes not assume equal rates of evolution on all lineages\nguarantees to produce a correct tree (if distances are additive)\n\nRegardless of the method you use, the end result is an evolutionary tree that shows the relationship among the various taxa based on the evolutionary model used.\n\n\n6.6.4 Pros and cons\nAs with all the methods discussed here, distance-clustering methods have their pros and cons.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nBenefits and limitations of distance based phylogenetic methods\nBenefits:\n\nComputationally less intensive compared to character-based methods like Maximum Likelihood or Bayesian Inference.\nVery fast, making them suitable for large datasets.\nVery straightforward to implement and interpret.\nFairly flexible in terms of evolutionary models that can be used.\nAlways produces a single tree.\nCompatible with bootstrapping and other methods for estimating tree confidence.\n\nLimitations:\n\nResults may be highly model dependent (the type of distance metric used). If your model is inaccurate, the resulting tree will also be inaccurate.\nNo way to determine if the single tree is best tree; there may be other shorter trees that better represent your data.\nCalculation of a distance metric results in a loss of information (you are taking basically a lot of sequence data and reducing it down to a single value).",

    "text": "6.7 Minimum evolution methods\nReferring back to Figure 6.2, though the usual pipeline for distance based approaches is to use one of the clustering algorithms discussed above to estimate an evolutionary tree, there is another approach to tree estimation from distance data that takes a different appoach to tree estimation, referred to as Minimum Evolution (ME) methods. ME aims to identify the phylogenetic tree with the smallest total sum of the branch lengths rather than a specific algorithm that results in a single tree.\nIn general, the ME method evaluates all possible tree topologies for the given taxa. For each topology, branch lengths are assigned using a least-squares method, which minimizes the discrepancy between observed distances (from the matrix) and predicted distances (from the tree). The tree with the smallest sum of branch lengths across all topologies is selected as the ME tree. Similar to parsimony, this criterion assumes that the true phylogeny minimizes evolutionary changes.\nThe ME approach is computationally intensive due to the need to evaluate numerous topologies. Recalling the discussion above for Maximum Parsimony and the number of possible trees for a given number of OTUs, obviously an exhaustive search is only possible with relatively small datasets before having to resort to heuristic search strategies. There are implementations for performing heuristic searches with ME, for example the program FASTME (Lefort, Desper, and Gascuel (2015)). The program MEGA also implements the ME approach.\nME approaches have been criticized in the past for being computationally complex, its dependence on distance estimates (but this is true of all distance based methods), that it can produce negative branch lengths, can take a long time to find an optimal solution, and that the results are usually no better than obtained using NJ methods. For these and other reasons, ME is not commonly used, and certainly less so with the switch to whole genome sequencing and other Next Generation Sequencing strategies.",

    "section": "6.8 Discrete (Inference/Optimality) Methods",
    "text": "6.8 Discrete (Inference/Optimality) Methods\nAgain referring back to Figure 6.2, the second broad class of molecular phylogenetic methods are referred to as Character based Inference/Optimality methods: character based as in the discrete characters themselves are used rather than a distance matrix, and inference/optimality since the nature of the analyses are very similar to that already discussed for Maximum Parsimony, i.e. infer a tree, then evaluate the tree using some criteria (e.g. the shortest tree length as assessed using parsimony).\nSimilar to what we did with MP analysis road map Listing 6.1, the same type of road map describing the generalized Inference/Optimality approach is:\n1. guess at a tree\n2. evaluate the tree using some defined **optimality criteria** which gives you a value defining how well the tree and data agree (X)\n3. make alternative guess at how the tree might look\n4. evaluate this tree using the optimality criteria (Y)\n5. compare the two trees by comparing X to Y\n6. accept the tree that is best based on criteria and keep this one calling it X;  discard the other\n7.Go to step (3) and repeat this process for some defined number of trees until you are convinced you have found the optimal tree (tree with the best value)\nIn terms of the optimality criteria, we have already discussed one criteria, that of maximum parsimony. We will address only two others briefly, Maximum Likelihood (ML) and Baysian Inference (BI) methods. In both these methods, the starting point is the same as with the distance based and parsimony methods as outlined in Figure 6.1: sequence data collection, construct a MSA, edit and trim the MSA, model selection and fitting.\n\n6.8.1 Model selection (DNA/prot data)\nThe models of DNA evolution used in both ML and BI methods are the same as previously discussed for the distance based methods. In this case you are not calculating a pairwise distance matrix using a specific model, but assessing the likelihood (ML) or probability (BI) for the distribution of the nucleotide base pairs given that model.\n\n\n6.8.2 Maximum Likelihood\nMaximum Likelihood (ML) can be a little challenging to understand at first. It is a statistical approach which aims to find the tree topology and branch lengths that maximize the likelihood of observing the given sequence data (alignment) under an explicit evolutionary model. The tree that has the greatest likelihood of giving rise to observed data is the preferred hypothesis concerning the relationship among the taxa.\nRewording the above, basically what ML is asking is given a tree (topology), the branch lengths (these are proportional to the number of nucleotide substitutions per site estimated to have occurred on each branch), and an evolutionary model (e.g. one of the models desctibed above), what is the chance (or likelihood) that combination will produce the observed dataset (sequence alignment). If it has a low chance (likelihood) of producing the data alignment, then it probably is not a good representation of the true tree given the evolutionary model. If is has a high likelihood of producing the alignment, then it may be a good estimation of the evolutionary relationship among the taxa (OTUs).\nAs usual, we will not go into the math associated with ML analysis. By way of a brief overview of how they work, once you have determined the optimal model of sequence evolution (Figure 6.13), ML calculates the likelihood of observing the sequence data at each site (called the site specific probability) one at a time for a given tree with branch lengths as determined based on the evolutionary model. The likelihood for the entire sequence alignment is computed as the product of these site-specific probabilities (assumes that sites evolve independently). For a group of possible trees, given a tree topology, branch lengths, and a set model of sequence evolution, the tree that has the highest likelihood (ML) is the tree with the best chance of producing the observed data, i.e. the best tree.\nCompare this to the criterium in Maximum Parsimony, where the best tree is the tree that results in fewest number of evolutionary changes.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nDo not be too concerned if the above is not that clear. It can be a little difficult to wrap your head around at first. The most important thing to remember is that the likelihood of a tree is always calculated using a specific model of sequence evolution, and the best tree for a given model has the highest likelihood hood value.\n\n\n\n\n6.8.3 Minimum Evolution (ME)\nWe have already discussed ME above since this method is based on a starting distance matrix. Technically speaking ME can be categorized as an Inference/Optimality model since the algorithm seeks to find that tree with the minimum sum of the branch lengths (that would be our criteria for assessing trees). We included it in the Distance Methods section since ME is oftentimes seen as an alternative to the NJ method. Just remember that ME searches through a group of candidate trees just like MP and ML.\n\n\n6.8.4 Bayesian Inference analysis\nBayesian Inference is also a statistical technique. Like ML, it can get a little complicated to explain. While ML calculated for each candidate tree the probability of the given aligned data set given the tree and an evolutionary model (\\(P(data|tree)\\)), Bayesian analysis asks a slightly different question: what is the probability of the tree given an aligned dataset and an evolutionary model (\\(P(tree|data)\\)). This intuitively makes better sense, but it can be difficult to actually estimate. In Bayesian statistics, the probability of a tree given the data is known as the posterior probability of the tree, and it kind of is what we really want to know. We will not go too far into Bayesian theory since it can get a little sticky. The formula for how this would work is:\n\\[\nP(tree|data)=\\frac{P(data|tree)P(tree)}{P(data)}\n\\] Notice that \\(P(data|tree)\\) is the likelihood of the tree (we discussed this briefly under ML section). The term \\(P(tree)\\) is what is called the prior probability of the tree. This gets assigned for the tree. The denominator \\(P(data)\\) is the prior probability of the data, which is the sum of the values obtained by multiplying each tree’s likelihood by its prior probability. the above shows that if we are willing to take a guess (or know) the two prior probabilities for all possible trees, then we can calculate what we want, the probability of getting a particular tree given our dataset. This is where the problem comes in. How do we estimate the prior probabilities? And here is where we fall back on our now familiar escape clause, how this is done is beyond the scope of this text.\nAs with all the methods discussed here, you would use a computer program to perform a Bayesian analysis, which takes care of all the complexity neatly and cleanly (the most commonly used is called MrBayes). The benefits of using Bayesian Inference is that results tend to be a little easier to interpret: a single tree with clade credibility values assigned to each branching point indicating how confident you can be of that particular branching pattern. Bayesian methods are computationally intensive but often yield reliable results, but in my experience the results are often no much different from a ML analysis.\nDifferences in the methods - Maximum likelihood, Bayesian analysis, and parsimony explicitly evoke models of evolution - Distance methods sort of, but not from phylogenetic perspective - useful in a lot of circumstances, e.g. very large data sets, like comparing whole genomes - Used to be controversy over which method is best - now generally accepted that ML (or Bayesian) methods are best; most sensitive to large evolutionary distances, but most are computationally time consuming and results depend on the specific model of evolution used; all but impossible to use for some data sets - Most commonly used packages contain different methods; - normally analyze data using multiple methods",

There actually are two ways to think about what we mean by confidence in a tree: (1) How well does my tree reflect the true tree, and (2) how much confidence can I have in my tree. When you think about it, these are two very different questions.\n\n6.9.1 How well does my tree reflect the true tree\nThis is usually unanswerable since one rarely knows the true evolutionary relationship among the taxa we are interested in. However, we can rephrase this question a little to “how good is a particular method for returning the true tree when it is know?” This can potentially be addressed experimentally using simulated datasets or by simulating diverging populations using an experimental organism that can be grown in the lab and reproduces rapidly, for example independent cultures of bacteria.\nIn terms of simulated datasets, simlated data can be generated based on the models of sequence divergence we discuss above. In brief, you set a known tree, then simulate data sets based on this tree using an evolutionary model, and then use various methods to see how well they do reconstructing the known tree from the simulated data. This was (and continues to be ) an important aspect of what is know theoretical phylogenetics, though sort of niche area in evolutionary biology as you probably can imagine.\n\n\n6.9.2 How much confidence can I have in the topology\nAnother way to word this question might be given the data set used, how well does my tree reflect the original data. This is a little easier to address, though the methods are not without controversy. Generally these are statistical methods, akin to those used in general data analysis, that are employed to test the robustness of the tree against randomness. The main techniques are used:\n\n6.9.2.1 Bootstrapping\nBootstrapping is a statistical resampling method used to asssess the relaibility of inferred trees. It works by resampling the data with replacement to create new datasets (called pseudo-replication). By repeatedly reconstructing trees from these “bootstrapped” datasets using the method, we can estimate the robustness of each node by how often it shows up in the bootstrapped replicates. For example, a bootstrap value of 0.7 means that clade appeared in 70% of the pseudreplicates. The results are usually shown as a bootstrap consensus tree, with bootstrap values tagged to various branch points. A high bootstrap value (e.g., 98%) indicates strong confidence in a particular relationship.\nNote that bootstrap values are not probabilities, though they may look like it at first glance. They are a measure of confidence given the data set used. Bootstrapping can be performed routinely, with just about every program that estimates evolutionary trees providing an option to estimate bootstrap support values. They can take quite a bit of time for complex datasets or models. Nonetheless, they are pretty much standard practice for any phylogenetics analysis.\n\n\n6.9.2.2 Parametric bootstrapping\nParametric bootstrapping is related to regular bootstrapping (technically called nonparametric bootstrapping), but differs in that it simulates new datasets based on a model and parameters estimated from the original data rather than resampling the original data. This works by estimating the parameters for a particular evolutionary model, then simulate synthetic data sets by simulating sequence evolution along a given tree. Each simulated dataset is then analyzed to infer a phylogenetic tree using the same methods applied to the original dataset, and the resulting trees compared to the original tree to determine the frequency of simulated trees that support the branching pattern of the original tree.\nParametric bootstrapping is not widely used since it tends to be extremely computationally intensive, and suffers from other limitations. Most standard phylogenetics packages do not support it, so it usually requires a fair degree of experience to run the specific programs for performing the simulations and incorporate them into a work flow.\n\n\n6.9.2.3 Likelihood/Bayesian estimates\nto be added\n\n\n\n6.9.3 Software for constructing phylogenies\nto be added",

    "text": "6.11 In closing\nIN PROGRESS\n\n6.11.1 Molecular Phylogenies in Real Life\nWhile basic approaches for inferring phylogenies are conceptually and computationally straightforward, modern phylogenetic analyses based on explicit statistical models (maximum likelihood or Bayesian) are complex and computationally intensive. Today phylogenetic analyses routinely include hundreds and sometimes thousands of taxa in our effort to build a comprehensive tree of life; this requires extensive computational infrastructure and ever more refined algorithms.\nIt is also important to note that inferred phylogenies for a set of taxa can vary depending on the data used for phylogenetic reconstruction. This is because gene trees—phylogenies that are inferred from a single locus—do not necessarily reflect the historical patterns of lineage-splitting and speciation (represented by species trees). Discrepancies between gene and species trees arise from gene duplication, horizontal gene transfer, and incomplete lineage sorting (the retention of ancestral polymorphisms across species). Hence, species trees are inferred by finding the consensus among many gene trees in an attempt to minimize the effects of outlier genes.\nIn summary, reconstructing phylogenetic trees is not trivial, and it is important to remember that phylogenies represent hypotheses. For many taxonomic groups, we have many alternative hypotheses about their evolutionary history; none of those hypotheses are necessarily wrong, and more data is typically needed to weigh the support for or against a particular phylogenetic tree. Conflicting phylogenetic trees can cause major controversies among systematists and evolutionary biologists. Most of these debates are held among taxonomic specialists, but others have significant implications for our broader understanding of the evolution of life on our planet. For example, sponges (Porifera) have long been considered the sister group to all other metazoans, but recent molecular phylogenetic analyses have suggested that comb jellies (Ctenophora) are in fact sister to the rest of Metazoa. The relative positioning of the two groups has major implications for our understanding of the evolution of animal body plans. The debate has been ongoing, and some Zoology textbooks—depending on the edition—have flip-flopped back and forth, presenting one or the other hypothesis depending on the most recent findings. It would probably be more accurate to present the two phylogenies as alternative hypotheses—at least until further evidence is available to settle the issue.",

    "text": "7.1 The Genotype-Phenotype Gap\nA common misconception about the origin of novel phenotypic variants is that they are primarily caused by mutations in protein-coding regions of the genome, which change the structure and function of a protein and ultimately create variation in a particular trait. In reality, the ways by which genetic variation can impact phenotypic traits are much more diverse and complex. While technological breakthroughs over the past decades have made it relatively easy to quantify genetic variation across the genome (see below), connecting mutations at particular loci to phenotypic traits has proven much more challenging. We call this the genotype-phenotype gap, and closing this gap is one of the biggest challenges in modern biology.\nPart of the complexity arises from the sheer number of genes in a genome. The human genome, for example, consists of over 30,000 genes. More importantly, one-to-one mapping—where one gene causes the expression of a specific phenotypic trait or at least an aspect of it—is relatively rare; rather, genes and their derivative products (different RNAs, proteins, and ultimately metabolites) interact in complex ways, such that the mapping is really many-to-many (many genes affect multiple traits at ones). These complexities become evident when we consider a simple genotype-phenotype framework, such as illustrated in Figure @ref(fig:g2p).\nEmergent phenotypic traits are the product of variation in the genome and the environmentally-dependent expression of that genomic variation. Figure adopted from Ritchie et al. (2005). Beetle photo by Udo Schmidt, CC BY-SA 2.0.\nRNA is transcribed from DNA by RNA polymerase, which produces messenger RNAs (mRNAs) that serve as templates for protein synthesis. After transcription, introns are removed by RNA splicing, and alternative splicing can recombine different exons from the same gene, which allows a single gene to code for multiple proteins with different functions. In addition, not all RNAs transcribed from DNA lead to functional proteins. Micro RNAs (miRNA) are short, non-coding RNA molecules that can silence mRNAs, and thus play a role in the post-transcriptional regulation of gene expression. Essentially, miRNAs bind to mRNAs with complementary sequences, which causes those mRNAs to degrade and interrupts the translation of mRNAs into functional proteins. In summary, RNAs play a critical role in multiple processes, not only because they encode templates for protein synthesis, but also because they can regulate the amount of protein produced by other genes.\nSimilar complexities are also evident at the proteome level. Sometimes, a single type of mRNA gives rise to a functional protein after translation. But many enzymes are actually multi-protein complexes and require information from multiple genes to make one functional unit. A great example are the enzymes associated with the oxidative phosphorylation (OxPhos) pathway in mitochondria, which produce the majority of the ATP needed for maintenance of cellular function. All five OxPhos enzymes are multi-protein complexes, and complex I (NADH dehydrogenase) is composed of 45 subunits, not counting the proteins involved in the assembly of the enzyme. Furthermore, some proteins actually act as transcription factors (TF in Figure @ref(fig:g2p)). These transcription factors bind to transcription factor binding sites (TFbs) in the genome, either enhancing or suppressing the expression of other genes. So proteins are also involved in complex feedback loops that regulate gene expression in response to various internal and external stimuli.\nFinally, different enzymes are organized into interconnected pathways that process the metabolites required for the maintenance of organismal function. Figure @ref(fig:metabolism) provides a glimpse at some of the metabolic pathways in human cells. As you can imagine, these metabolic networks are full of redundancy, such that similar phenotypic outcomes may actually be caused by different underlying mechanisms.\nPathway map representing the molecular interaction, reaction, and relation networks for human metabolism. Check out the KEGG Pathway Database for an interactive version.\nIt is the action and interaction of biological processes across all of these levels of organismal organization that ultimately shape the phenotypic traits frequently studied by evolutionary biologists. As you can imagine, reconciling evolutionary patterns across these levels is not always trivial, simply because we don’t always know what genes are connected to what traits. In addition, even superficial examination of genotype-phenotype relationships shows that variation in phenotypes can not only arise from variation in protein structure and function, but also differences in when, where, and at what levels proteins are expressed. Phenotypic variants may arise as a consequence of changes in the amino acid sequences of proteins, or changes in the regulation of protein expression. In that light, let’s investigate how different mutations arise in the genome, how they might impact organismal phenotypes, and what their potential evolutionary ramifications are.",

    "section": "7.2 Mutation: The Fundamental Source of Novelty",
    "text": "7.2 Mutation: The Fundamental Source of Novelty\nMutation is the fundamental source of variation that selection can act upon to create evolutionary change. Any change in the nucleotide sequence of a genome is considered a mutation. Mutations can involve single nucleotide substitutions, insertions and deletions (also called indels), inversions of chromosome segments, duplication of chromosome segments, and partial and complete genome duplications. Different types of mutations have different molecular origins and different consequences for the expression of phenotypic traits. Consequently, they also have different evolutionary implications.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDefinition: Mutation\n\n\n\nA mutation is a change in DNA sequence, resulting in a variant form (allele) that can be passed on to subsequent generations.\n\n\n\n7.2.1 Point Mutations\nPoint mutations are changes in a single nucleotide of DNA. They include transitions and transversions that cause single nucleotide substitutions as well as single nucleotide insertions and deletions. Point mutations cause single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs; single base-pair differences in the DNA sequence), which are the basis for many population genetic analyses.\n\nOrigins\nPoint mutations primarily arise from mistakes during DNA replication. The mutations are either caused by random errors made by DNA polymerase (which copies the DNA during replication) or by random errors made by enzymes involved in DNA repair.\n\n\nPhenotypic Impact and Evolutionary Consequences\nThe phenotypic impacts and evolutionary consequences of point mutations depend on the location and nature of the mutation.\nIn protein-coding regions of the genome, single nucleotide substitutions can either be synonymous (silent) or nonsynonymous. Synonymous mutations arise due to redundancy of the genetic code, where multiple nucleotide triplets encode for the same amino acid (Figure @ref(fig:geneticcode)). For example, a mutation from AGG to AGA has no effect on the resulting amino acid sequence, because both triplets encode for arginine. Since such synonymous mutations do not translate to changes in the resulting protein, there are no consequences for expressed phenotypes and the mutation is not visible to selection (i.e., it has no fitness consequences).\n\n\n\n\n\nDiagram of the genetic code showing which DNA bases code for which amino acids (in different colors).\n\n\n\n\nIn contrast, nonsynonymous substitutions do change the amino acid sequence of the resulting protein (e.g., AGG to AGT changes arginine to serine; @ref(fig:geneticcode)). Amino acid substitutions can fundamentally change the structure and function of proteins, with corresponding consequences for downstream phenotypes. There are three potential evolutionary consequences of nonsynonymous substitutions: (i) the altered protein and resulting phenotypic changes are deleterious, imposing a fitness disadvantage for the individual; (ii) the altered protein and resulting phenotypic changes are beneficial, providing a fitness advantage for the individual; or (iii) the altered protein does not change its structure and function in a significant way, in which case even a nonsynonymous mutation can be selectively neutral.\nProtein-coding regions of the genome can also be impacted by indels. Single nucleotide indels are known as frameshift mutations, because they alter the reading frame at which nucleotide triplets are translated into amino acids. Consequently, an insertion or a deletion of a single nucleotide can completely change the amino acid sequence of the resulting protein or introduce a premature stop codon (Figure @ref(fig:frameshift)). Many frameshift mutations cause loss of function in a protein and consequently lead to fitness reductions in individuals carrying the mutation.\n\n\n\n\n\nFrameshift mutations caused by insertions or deletions change the amino acid sequence and potentially insert premature stop codons.\n\n\n\n\nProtein-coding regions only make up about 1 % of the human genome (and even less in some other organisms). Point mutations can also occur in non-coding genomic regions. Some non-coding regions serve important functions in gene regulation (e.g., transcription factor binding sites, non-coding RNAs) or in mRNA processing and protein translation (e.g., introns). Hence, point mutations in such genomic regions may still impact organismal phenotypes, and—depending on the context—they can come with fitness costs or benefits.\nFinally, putatively non-functional genomic regions (pseudogenes and repeat sequences caused by transposons and retrotransposons) can make up large portions of a genome. Point mutations in these genomic regions largely have no fitness consequences; hence, they tend to be selectively neutral.\n\n\n\n7.2.2 Inversions\nInversions are regions of chromosomes that are flipped in direction. These mutations do not change the amount or kind of genetic material in the genome, only its sequential arrangement (Figure @ref(fig:inversion)).\n\n\n\n\n\nInversions are caused when double breaks in the DNA (indicated by asterisks) are fixed upon a central element flipping in direction.\n\n\n\n\n\nOrigins\nInversions are caused by double DNA breaks, in which the broken central piece is flipped before the DNA strands are joined back together by DNA ligase. While inversions can be only a few base pairs long (in which case they can act like point mutations), some are very large (&gt;4 megabases) and contain multiple functional genes.\n\n\nPhenotypic Impact and Evolutionary Consequences\nIf the break points are located within a functional gene, inversions can cause the loss of function and corresponding negative impacts on phenotypic expression and fitness. In most cases, however, break points are located in intergenic regions, such that inversions have no visible phenotypic repercussions. Nonetheless, inversions can play an important role in evolution, especially if they contain multiple functional genes. In heterozygous individuals that have one copy of the chromosome with and one without the inversion, the likelihood of recombination within the inversion is reduced because of mechanical pairing issues associated with non-complimentary DNA. As a result, genes within an inversion are often inherited in blocks and have a reduced chance to be reshuffled during sex and recombination.\n\n\n\n7.2.3 Gene Duplication\nGene duplication occurs when entire segments of a chromosome containing functional genes are duplicated, creating novel copies in the genome.\n\nOrigins\nMost gene duplications arise from unequal crossing-overs during meiosis, where misalignment of homologous chromosomes leads to daughter chromosomes of different lengths. One daughter chromosome contains a duplicated segment that is missing from the other (Figure @ref(fig:uneqcross)). Gene duplications can also be associated with replication slippage and retrotransposon activity.\n\n\n\n\n\nCrossing-over between misaligned chromosomes during meiosis (A) causes DNA segments to be deleted in one and inserted in the other chromosome (B).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhenotypic Impact and Evolutionary Consequences\nIndividuals that inherit a chromosome with a deleted essential gene may suffer from negative phenotypic and fitness effects. Those that inherit a chromosome with a duplication, however, are unlikely to suffer from adverse consequences. There are two possible evolutionary consequences for the genes within a duplication. First, a duplicated gene may accumulate a variety of mutations, even deleterious ones. But since a functional copy is still present in the genome, individual carriers will not face any fitness reductions. As deleterious mutations accumulate in the duplicated gene, it will eventually become a non-functional pseudogene. These pseudogenes are passed on across generations, as discussed in Chapter 2. Alternatively, a duplicated gene may accumulate mutations that change the structure and function of the resulting protein in a beneficial way, enhancing the fitness of the carrier. As such, gene duplication can be a major source of genomic novelty, and many gene families have arisen through duplication.\nHemoglobin genes, for example, have duplicated repeatedly during vertebrate evolution. Different hemoglobin genes in the human genome vary in their functional properties and expression depending on developmental stage or environmental conditions. Hemoglobins expressed during fetal development have a higher oxygen affinity than the mother’s hemoglobin, allowing the fetus to extract oxygen from the mother’s blood. Similarly, our bodies express different types of hemoglobins during acclimation to low oxygen concentrations at high altitudes. Shifting to the expression of alternative hemoglobins takes time, which explains why you may experience altitude sickness on the first days of your Colorado vacation. Once you are acclimated, the higher oxygen binding capacity of alternative hemoglobins allows you to perform normally even at higher altitudes, which is why some athletes use high-elevation training to gain an advantage for competitions close to sea level. Consequently, gene duplication is an important source of novelty in the genome and allows for the evolution of specialized functions that are constrained by the number of loci.\n\n\n\n7.2.4 Genome Duplication\nGenome duplications occur when additional copies of the entire genome are generated, leading to polyploidy. In some instances, genome duplications can be partial, if only a subset of chromosomes are duplicated.\n\nOrigins\nPartial and complete genome duplications occur because of segregation errors during meiosis. Non-disjunction during the anaphase of meiosis I or II leads to a failure of correct chromosome separation into daughter cells, resulting in gametes with extra or missing chromosomes.\n\n\n\n\n\nMetaphase: Chromosomes line up in the middle plane, the meiotic spindle forms, and the kinetochores (black) of sister chromatids attach to the microtubules (blue lines). Anaphase: Sister chromatids separate and the microtubules pull them in opposite directions. The chromosome shown in purple fails to separate properly, with its sister chromatids sticking together and getting pulled to the same side. This results in nondisjunction of the chromosome.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhenotypic Impact and Evolutionary Consequences\nWhole genome duplications do not typically have immediate negative consequences for the carrier. Like gene duplication, it may actually allow for the evolution of novel genes, because they release constraints associated with pleiotropic effects. However, polyploids are instantaneously reproductively isolated from their ancestors, because proper meiosis is not possible with an uneven number of sister chromosomes. Hence, we see polyploid lineages more commonly in organisms with asexual reproduction or self-fertilization, like plants. In these cases, polyploidization is associated with instantaneous speciation.\nIn contrast, partial genome duplications often have negative fitness consequences for the carrier. This is thought to be related to gene dosage effects, where the amount of gene product (e.g., protein) is correlated with the number of copies of a particular gene in the genome. Hence, partial genome duplication can lead to biases in the expression of some—but not all—genes, creating imbalances in the developmental and metabolic networks that have been fine-tuned by evolution.",

    "text": "7.3 Mutation Rates\nPoint mutations are by far the most common mutations in the genome. Estimation of mutation rates is not trivial, and estimates vary depending on how these rates are actually quantified. The earliest estimates came from experimental mutation accumulation lines, where mutation rates were estimated based on visible phenotypic mutations that were likely caused by loss of function mutations (e.g., premature stop-codons, frame-shift mutations, etc.). These experiments estimated mutations rates per genome per generation, and revealed values between 0.0025 in E. coli and 1.6 in humans (Table 4.1).\nThe 640-fold variation in the organisms listed in Table 4.1 is primarily caused by two factors. Per-genome mutation rates roughly scale with genome size; larger genomes tend to have have a higher likelihood of accruing copy errors. More importantly, however, mutation rates are higher in multicellular organisms. In unicellular organisms, every round of DNA replication represents a new generation. In contrast, mutations also occur during mitosis as multicellular bodies develop. Any mutation within the germ line will be passed on to the next generation.\n\nTable 4.1: Mutation rates for different taxa.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTaxon\nMutation rate (per genome per generation)\n\n\n\n\nEscherichia coli\n0.0025\n\n\nSaccharomyces acidocaldarius\n0.0018\n\n\nSaccharomyces cerevisiae\n0.0027\n\n\nCaenorhabditis elegans\n0.0360\n\n\nMus musculus\n0.9000\n\n\nHomo sapiens\n1.6000\n\n\n\nWhile these mutation rates seem small, it is important to remember that a population typically consists of many genomes (i.e., individuals). For example, an industrial batch of beer is estimated to harbor about 100 billion (1011) yeast cells. Given a mutation rate of 0.0027 (Table 4.1), that includes 270 million (2.7*108) mutations. Considering that yeast has a genome size of about 12 Mb (1.2*107 base pairs), that means that every nucleotide in the genome might mutate up to 20 times in every generation. You can conduct the same calculation with humans (population size: 7.9 billion; genome size: 3.2*109 base pairs), and you will find that every nucleotide may mutate about twice in each generation. So while the likelihood for a particular mutation to occur in an individual is very small, the mutational input—especially in large populations—can be considerable.\nMore importantly, mutation rate estimates based on mutation accumulation experiments vastly underestimate actual mutation rates. As discussed above, many mutations have no or only minute phenotypic effects, and are thus impossible to detect during phenotype screens. Unsurprisingly, mutation rate estimates based on DNA sequencing have revealed much higher mutation rates. For example, the rate of nucleotide substitutions in humans is estimated at about 1 in 108 in every generation. Extrapolated for the size of the human genome, this means that every gamete produced exhibits about 30 mutations.",

    "text": "8.1 Section Summary\nIn Chapter 1, we discussed that one way to define evolution was the change in allele frequencies in a population over time. We also discussed in Chapter 2 the role natural selection plays in the evolution of adaptations, but that there also exists other mechanisms the drive evolution in addition to natural selection. In the following chapters we will explore how the various mechanisms that drive evolution work by focusing on how they effect the change in the frequency of alleles in a population. We will do this by modeling the various mechanisms with a focus on the how they work individually and in concert. This takes us into the field of population genetics, also referred to as evolutionary genetics. Though evolutionary genetics can get more than a little math and statistics heavy, our attempt here is not for you to get lost in the maths and equations, but to come to a more deeper understanding of the how evolution works by understanding the fundamentals of the various mechanisms work1. We will be discussing various equations and statistical principles as necessary, but will try to keep them to a minimum.\nWhat are the mechanisms that drive evolution? To be specific, they are:\nIn ?sec-mutvar we discussed the fuel that drives the evolutionary engine, variation in the genome. Later on we will expand these ideas to phenotypic variation, but for the next couple of chapters we will focus on what happens to that variation over time.\nWe will begin our discussion here by first clarifying how allele frequencies are calculated. We will then discuss the null model of evolution that will be essential to understanding how the various mechanisms work to drive evolution, Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium2. Understanding HW equilibrium will then allow us to explore how the various mechanisms work individually and in concert, starting with the concept of genetic drift (Chapter 9). Most texts would begin the discussion on evolutionary genetics with natural selection, but in my opinion genetic drift, which we will refer as just drift for brevity’s sake, is much more important than it is usually given credit for. That is not to say that it is more important than selection or migration or any of the the other mechanisms, just that it is more important than usually presented in introductory biology texts or many introductory evolution texts. Plus it will give us an opportunity to move beyond the deterministic models for the various other mechanisms as we discuss them, making our discussions a little more reality based.\nFollowing drift, we will then move on to discuss in great detail selection Chapter 10, followed by migration Chapter 12, mutation, and nonrandom mating.",

    "section": "8.2 Calculating allele frequencies",
    "text": "8.2 Calculating allele frequencies\nFor population genetic analyses, researchers today typically sample dozens to hundreds of individuals from one or many populations for genotyping usually by DNA sequencing. Based on the sequencing data, we can determine the genotype of each individual. Assuming a diploid organism, single gene with two alleles (bi-allelic locus) designated as \\(A\\) and \\(a\\), there are three possible genotypes: \\(AA\\), \\(Aa\\), and \\(aa\\). At a population level, we can then describe genetic variation with two metrics: the relative genotype frequency and the relative allele frequency in the population.\nThe relative genotype frequency is the proportion of individuals in a population with a particular genotype, one measure of the distribution of genetic variation in a population. The table below summarizes hw we extimate the genotype frequecies.\n\n\n\nTable 8.1: Genotype table\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGenotype\n\\(AA\\)\n\\(Aa\\)\n\\(aa\\)\nSum\n\n\n\n\nCounts\n\\(N_{AA}\\)\n\\(N_{Aa}\\)\n\\(N_{aa}\\)\n\\(N_T\\)\n\n\nFreq (\\(f_{ij}\\))\n\\(\\frac{N_{AA}}{N_T}\\)\n\\(\\frac{N_{Aa}}{N_T}\\)\n\\(\\frac{N_{aa}}{N_T}\\)\n\\(1.0\\)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe sum of genotype frequencies (\\(f\\)) equals one, as shown here for a bi-allelic locus:\n\\[\n\\frac{N_{AA}}{N_T} + \\frac{N_{Aa}}{N_T} + \\frac{N_{aa}}{N_T} = f_{AA}+f_{Aa}+f_{aa} = 1.0\n\\tag{8.1}\\]\nThe relative allele frequency is the proportion of different alleles at a particular locus and measures the amount of genetic variation in a population. If you can identify the different genotypes in a population, than the allele frequencies can be easily calculated based on the relative genotype frequencies. For a bi-allelic locus in a diploid organism, the frequencies of \\(A\\) allele is designated \\(p\\) (\\(f_A=p\\)) and \\(a\\) allele \\(q\\) (\\(f_a=q\\)). We do this by effectively counting the number of allele copies in the population and divide that by the total number of allele copies in a population, which for a diploid organism is (\\(2N_T\\)). To determine the number of allele copies for an allele, each homozygus individual contributes two copies of the specific allele, so there are \\(2N_{AA}\\) allele copies from the homozygotes, while the heterozygous genotype contributes only one allele copy, or \\(N_{Aa}\\).\nTo calculate the relative allele frequency for the \\(A\\) allele then:\n\\[\nf_A = p = \\frac{2N_{AA}+N_{Aa}}{2N_T}\n\\]\nA little bit of simple algebra to simplify gives:\n\\[\np=\\frac{2N_{AA}}{2N_T}+\\frac{N_{Aa}}{2N_T}=\\frac{N_{AA}}{N_T}+\\frac{1}{2}\\Big(\\frac{N_{Aa}}{N_T}\\Big) = f_{AA}+\\frac{1}{2}(f_{Aa})\n\\]\nTo show the above a little cleaner:\n\\[\nf_A=p=\\frac{2f_{AA}+f_{Aa}}{2(f_{AA}+f_{Aa}+f_{aa})}=f_{AA}+\\frac{1}{2}(f_{Aa})\n\\tag{8.2}\\]\nLikewise for the alternative allele \\(a\\):\n\\[\nf_a=q=\\frac{2f_{aa}+f_{Aa}}{2(f_{AA}+f_{Aa}+f_{aa})}=f_{aa}+0.5*f_{Aa}\n\\tag{8.3}\\]\nRemember, if Equation Equation 8.1 is true, then the sum of p and q must also be one (\\(p+q=1.0\\)).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWarning\n\n\n\nMistakes frequently happen during the calculation of allele frequencies. I recommend that you calculate p and q independently and then check whether the sum of your calculated values equals one. If not, you made a mistake in your calculation.",

    "text": "8.3 Hardy Weinberg: A Null Model for Evolution\nPopulation genetics does not just allow us to quantify and describe genetic variation in populations; it also provides a powerful tool to address evolutionary hypotheses. Before we dive into that, I want to revisit the definition of evolution from Chapter 1, where we described evolution as “change in the inherited traits of a population across successive generations”. With genetics in mind, we reframed that definition to explicitly address the mechanisms that underlie heredity:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDefinition: Evolution\n\n\n\nEvolution is the change of allele frequencies across successive generations.\n\n\nThe predictable relationship between genotype and allele frequencies lets us use population genetic principles to determine whether evolution is happening. As already shown, we can infer allele frequencies based on measured genotype frequencies (Equations Equation 8.2 and Equation 8.3). If we assume that no evolutionary forces are acting on a population (Important 8.1), we can predict the genotype frequencies of the next generation using the following formula (see Figure 8.1) for a graphical explanation).\n\\[\nf_{AA}=p^2\n\\tag{8.4}\\]\n\\[\nf_{Aa}=2pq\n\\tag{8.5}\\]\n\\[\nf_{aa}=q^2\n\\tag{8.6}\\]\nSince these are frequencies, then:\n\\[\np^2+2pq+q^2=1\n\\tag{8.7}\\]\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportant\n\n\n\nUnfortunately I have found over the years that many students will confuse (eqn-7?) as the most important take away from HW. (eqn-7?) is actually kind of trivial since of course the sum of the relative gentoype frequencies will be \\(1.0\\), they are relative frequencies. It is very important that you understand, the important result of HW is that under the assumptions of the model, the genotype frequencies will be:\n\nHardy Weinberg genotype frequencies\n\n\nGenotype\n\\(AA\\)\n\\(Aa\\)\n\\(aa\\)\nSum\n\n\n\n\n\n\\(f_{AA}\\)\n\\(f_{Aa}\\)\n\\(f_{aa}\\)\n1.0\n\n\nFreq (\\(f_{ij}\\))\n\\(p^2\\)\n\\(2pq\\)\n\\(q^2\\)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 8.1: A modified Punnett square illustrates the relationship between allele frequencies (p and q) and the resulting genotype frequencies (p2, 2pq, and q2) under the assumptions of the Hardy-Weinberg principle.\n\n\n\nSince what we are interested in is the change in allele frequencies over time, our definition of evolution, we can use (eqn-2?) above to calculate the allele frequencies in the next generation from the genotype frequencies.\n\\[\np'= f_{AA} + 1/2(f_{Aa})\n\\]\n\\[\np'= p^2 + 1/2(2pq) = p^2 + pq\n\\]\nRecalling that \\(p+q=1\\) and a little simple algebra shows:\n\\[\np'= p^2 + pq = p(p+q) = p\n\\tag{8.8}\\]\nObviously the same would be true for the other allele \\(a\\):\n\\[\nq'= q^2 + pq = q(p+q) = q\n\\]\nThis is the second important conclusion of Hardy-Weinberg: (eqn-8?) tells us that under the assumptions of Hardy-Weinberg, there will be no changes in allele frequencies over time.\nThis predictability of genotype and allele frequencies across generations is known as the Hardy-Weinberg principle (or equilibrium), which states that genotype and allele frequencies in a population will remain constant across generations as long as there are no evolutionary forces acting on that population. Those evolutionary forces are Important 8.1.\nA third important point about the Hardy-Weinberg principle is that it can be used as a null model to test whether any evolutionary forces are acting on a particular locus. To do so, we just need to genotype a representative sample of individuals in a population and calculate relative allele frequencies based on the observed genotype frequencies Equation 8.2 and Equation 8.3. Then, we can calculate the idealized genotype frequencies predicted by Hardy-Weinberg using Equation 8.4, Equation 8.5, and Equation 8.6. If the calculated idealized genotype frequencies match the initially observed genotype frequencies, we say that the population is in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium (Figure 8.2)3. In this case, the observable data matches the model prediction, meaning that the assumptions underlying the model are correct: there are no evolutionary forces acting on that locus.\nIn contrast, if the calculated idealized genotype frequencies do not match the initially observed genotype frequencies, the population is in Hardy-Weinberg disequilibrium (Figure 8.2). Since we cannot correctly calculate genotype frequencies based on the measured allele frequencies, some assumption of the Hardy-Weinberg model must be violated; i.e. at least one evolutionary force must be acting on the locus, causing an over representation of some genotypes relative to the others. This approach will not tell you which of the evolutionary forces caused the observed discrepancy; sorting that out requires additional research.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 8.2\n\n\n\nApplying the Hardy-Weinberg principle is nonetheless a good starting point, because we can genotype individuals in a population at many loci in the genome, apply the Hardy-Weinberg principle at each locus, and identify regions of the genome where evolutionary forces are likely acting to change allele frequencies across generations. It is a simple approach to find a needle in a haystack, but comes with a lot of caveats.\nA more important aspect of HW as a null model is that it allows us to ask questions concerning what would happen to the change in allele frequencies if we relax the assumptions of the model, say for example if natural selection is acting on the population. We can use HW expectations to develop relatively simple models to assess the impacts of mutation, migration, selection, and drift by relaxing each of these assumption individually and determine how it might impact the change in allele frequencies over time. This is the basis of the field of evolutionary population genetics, and allows us to explore how the various mechanisms that drive evolution work, which we will be focusing on in the next couple of chapters.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHardy Weinberg Equilibrium\n\n\n\nFor a diploid organism, a single gene (locus) with two alleles, assuming (1) no new mutation, (2) no migration from an outside population, (3) no natural selection acting on the gene, (4) an infinite population size (no drift), and (5) random mating (no nonrandom mating, a double negative), then:\nthe genotype frequencies in a population will be \\(p2\\), \\(2pq\\), and \\(q^2\\), where \\(p=\\) frequency of one allele and \\(q\\) = the frequency of the alternate allele in the population.\nthe genotype frequencies and the allele frequencies will not change over time.\nHW acts as a null model in evolution, allowing us to model how the mechanisms of evolution work.",

    "section": "",
    "text": "9.1 What is genetic drift?\nWhen population sizes are finite—and especially when they are small—random chance affects evolutionary dynamics. These stochastic changes in allele frequencies across generations is what we refer to as genetic drift. While selection is differential reproductive success caused by differential performance of variants, genetic drift is differential reproductive success that just happens. In contrast to selection, which tends to increase average fitness across generations, genetic drift does not lead to adaptation. Due to the random nature of genetic drift, populations subject to it evolve on distinct trajectories. So, if you re-run simulations allowing for drift with the same parameters, you will get a unique evolutionary path every single time1. The random nature of drift assures that no evolutionary trajectory is like another.\nAt the most basic level, evolution by genetic drift happens as a consequence of sampling error across generations. If you imagine a locus with two alleles (\\(A\\) and \\(a\\)) of equal frequency (\\(p=q=0.5\\)) in a population with an infinite population size, the theoretically predicted allele frequencies under Hardy-Weinberg conditions in the next and subsequent generations will of course remain at \\(p=q=0.5\\). However, if the population sizze is finite, chance might cause significant deviations from theoretical expectations. Every individual in the population essentially has a 50% chance to inherit the \\(A\\)-allele on its first chromosome, and a 50% chance to inherit the \\(A\\)-allele on its second chromosome. In other words, the genotype an individual inherits in absence of selection is equivalent to two coin tosses (one for each allele inherited), where the probability for receiving a particular genotype is dependent on the allele frequencies in the population. We can simulate this manually using a large jar of pennies or M&Ms, but it is much more efficient using statistical software like R2. Without going into any further detail, we can use the rbinom() function to simulate a coin toss or choosing alleles from a population with (\\(p=q=0.5\\)), setting a with the allele frequency (\\(p\\)) and the population size (\\(N\\)) as input variables. So for the Devil’s Hole pupfish (Figure 9.1), with its very low population size of 38, the simulated allele frequency in the next generation is:\nN=38\np=0.5\nrbinom(1, size=2*N, prob=p)/(2*N)\n\n[1] 0.5394737\nIf we repeat this simulation 1,000 times, you can see that there can be substantial deviations from the predicted allele frequency of \\(p=0.5\\) (Figure 9.2). Only about 10% of observations fall within the predicted 0.5-bin, and the frequency of \\(A\\) can be as low as 0.3 and as high as 0.7 just because of random chance. That is a massive shift in allele frequency across a single generation.\nAs you know from experience, the number of coin tosses impacts how close a result matches the theoretical predictions. If you toss your coin ten times, you may get tails eight times, which represents a 60% deviation from the theoretical prediction. However, the more often you toss your coin, the closer your overall frequency of tails will get to the predicted 50%. The same principle applies to the effects of genetic drift as a function of population size. When population sizes are small, genetic drift can induce substantial deviations from theoretical predictions, but the effects of drift get smaller as populations size increases. Using the same simulation as above—but with a population size \\(N\\) of 1,000—reveals that observed allele frequencies align much better with theoretical predictions, with a spread of observed allele frequencies of \\(A\\) between 0.46 and 0.54 (Figure 9.2).\nFigure 9.2: Observed distributions of allele frequencies by randomly selecting alleles (A or a) from a pool with equal allele frequencies (p=0.5). The deviation from theoretical expectations are much larger for the small population (N=38) than for the larger population (N=1,000). This illustrates how the strenth of genetic drift declines as a function of population size.\nTo summarize, in small populations, and to some extent in large populations as well, chance events produce outcomes which differ from the theoretical expectations based on HW equilibrium (in our HW model, a violation of the assumption of an infinite population size). This produces random discrepancies from expectation over repeated sampling, basically a sort of sampling error. This sampling error in the production of gametes in finite sized populations is what we call genetic drift. Because it is random, it becomes difficult to predict whether the frequency of an allele will increase or decrease in each generation. We can estimate the probabiity of some events happening, but we can not predict exactly what will happen from generation to generation. It is fundamentally a statistical phenomena. The larger the sample size, the greater the chance our sample will follow expectations. In genetics, the larger the sample of gametes (population size), the closer we will get to HW proportions.\nBecause of this ongoing random change over generations, genetic drift does cause evolution (as defined), but it cannot produce adaptations. Only natural selection can lead to a directed increase in the frequency of adaptive variation in a population. Sometimes it can be difficult to differentiate drift from selection in terms of changes in allele frequencies, and for this reason it is important we understand how drift works, and how it can impact changes in allele frequencies even when selection is working on the same alleles.",

    "text": "9.2 Drift as a mechanism in evolution\nThere are equations that model the effects of drift, but they can be a little intimidating. In my experience the best way to learn about drift, the effects of population size on drift, and the impact of drift on a population is through computer simulations, which we will be doing in lab. In lab we will set up a series of in silico experiments to address the topics below, but for now, we will just summarize the major points.\n\n9.2.1 Effects of population size\nSo how exactly does population size impact the strength of genetic drift? As we will see in lab, the smaller the population size, the more effective genetic drift is in changing allele frequencies among generations. Very small populations can experience drastic changes in allele frequencies across generations. Genetic drift can also impact large populations, it just is less effective in terms the extent of change in allele frequency between generations and it takes far longer for its effects to be felt.\n\n\n9.2.2 Fate of an allele under drift\nThe fate of any allele in a population under drift is to either become fixed (defined as \\(p=1.0\\)) or lost (defined as \\(p=0.0\\)).3 The speed at which this happens will depend on the population size. The smaller the population size, the faster an allele will become fixed or lost. The larger the population, the longer it takes. In very large populations it may take much too long to even detect a change in allele frequencies among generations, let alone the loss or fixation, but given enough patience, it will eventually happen.\n\n\n9.2.3 Probability of an allele getting fixed by drift\nThe probabilility that an allele will be fixed (\\(p=1.0\\)) in a population due to drift is equal to the frequency of that allele in the population at any one generation. Since the frequency of alleles will change randomly over time, then so does the probability that allele will become fixed. Clearly though, as an allele becomes more and more common just by chance, then the probability of it eventually becoming fixed increases as well. When you are really close to the boundaries of allele frequencies (i.e. \\(p=0\\) and \\(p=1.0\\)), then you can say with fair amount of certainty what the fate of that allele will be. However, because it is a stochastic process, you could find an allele well on the path to becoming fixed, only to suddenly begin decreasing in frequency and eventually becoming lost. Thus is randomness.\nIt should go without mention that the probably of an allele being lost in a population is then \\((1-p)\\) at any one time.\n\n\n9.2.4 Fate of a new mutation (allele)\nIf a new neutral mutation (not under the effects of selection) arises in a population of diploid organisms with a population size of \\(N\\), the frequency of the new allele is \\(\\frac{1}{2N}\\).4 Since each neutral allele drifting to fixation is equal to the allele frequency, then the likelihood that the a new allele gets fixed in a population is \\(\\frac{1}{2N}\\). This means that new alleles are more likely to get fixed in a small population by chance than in a large population. This seems a little counter intuitive. One would think that a large population would tend to harbor more new variation than a small population, but one might think that is not true since the probability of a new mutation getting fixed in a large population is very small, so most new mutations should get lost. The solution to this conundrum is that drift is less effective in a large population, so larger populations should in fact carry a large number of neutral alleles segregating at low frequencies for longer periods of time. They will have a very low probably of becoming fixed.\n\nUP TO THIS POINT\n\n\n9.2.5 Effects on the rate of evoltion\nRates of evolution caused by drift 1. rate at which new alleles caused by mutation are substituted for other alleles already present 2. w/o selection (i.e. only drift) rate of substitution should be equal to the mutation rate ▪ 2Nv new alleles created each generation ▪ frequency of a new allele will be 1/2N ▪ probablility that an allele will be fixed is equal to its frequency in a population ▪ therefore, 2Nv*1/2N = v = substitution rate 3. a. note the rate of substitution is independent of populationn size b. however a large population – generates and maintains more variation then small population other mechanisms then drift are acting on new mutations a. when a mutation appears it can be deleterious, neutral, or advantageous; what happens to the new allele depends on where it falls along this spectrum\n\ndeleterious alleles appear but are eliminated by selection\nneutral mutations appear and are fixed or lost by chance iii.advantageous alleles appear and are eventually fixed\n\n\n\nthe relative importance of neutral versus selection in determining substitution rates is an issue with a long history in the field of evolution, and continues to be controversial to this day\nneutral theory of molecular evolution – vast majority of mutations are effectively neutral, and therefore the rate of subst equals the mutation rate; selection acts only on deleterious mutations; very small role for the action of selection maintaining genetic variation; selection acts to purify population of deleterious mutants; allows for a limited amount of positive selection,which reach fixation quickly\nmolecular clock\nselection theory – advantageous mutations are more common then predicted under the neutral model, and therefore rate of subst will reflect the action of natural selection; balancing selection; neutral mutations occur, but selection is more important then under neutral model\n\n\n\n9.2.6 Effects on population heterozygosity\n\nsee this if you think about the graph we made in lab heterozygotes at highest freq when p=0.5, and lower as p got larger or smaller • freq of heterozygotes is called the population heterozygosity • decreases in a finite population as: Hg+1=Hg[1-1/2N]\n\ne.g. fruit flies in lab; bw allele; 107 populations of 16 each, 19 generations — saw cjhange in allele freq over generations such that 30 populations became fixed for one allele, 28 the other — loss of heterozygosity fit expectations • why is this important: • loss of variability in population; evolution depends on variation • recall heterosis and overdominance role in maintaining variation • evidence for a relationship between levels of heterozygosity and fitness\nRate of drift is dependent on population size 1. 2. small population size, faster allele will go to fixation/loss loss of heterozygosity depends on population size a. smaller the population the more rapid the loss of heterozygosity\nSummary: 1. small popn, drift leads to random fixation of alleles and reduced heterozygosity a. genetic variability if the fuel of evolution b. loss of heterozygosity entails an increase in homozygosity, which often leads to reduced fitness (in lab studies) c. due to inbreeding depression and the exposure of deleterious mutants\n\n\n9.2.7 Effective population size\nEffective population size 1. important to understand that the population size we need to consider is not the census population size (ecological measure); large error associated with measure a. we want the number of reproducing individuals, the number contributing to next generation b. some aspects of life history may act to reduce the actual numbers of breeding individual to far below census levels c. we call this effective population size Ne. i. size of an ideal theoretical population that would lose (or have) heterozygosity (Het) at the observed rate (or level) ii. e.g. Fig 6.15 – census population size; observed loss of Het which is greater then expected based on the census popn size; because some individual do not equally contribute to breeding, so the effective number of breeders is less then the census size 2. a number of factors are known to influence Ne a. sex ratios Ne=(4NmNf)/(Nm+Nf) where Nm= number of males Nf= number of females as the number of males and females get more different, the Ne decreases b. population fluctuations i. as popn fluctuates in size, H will decrease fast while popn goes through “bottleneck” ii. Ne is disproportionally effected by small N iii.Ne is the harmonic mean of N c. small breeding groups i. population divided into a number of small groups ii. Ne influenced by degree of subdivision and m among groups iii.as m increases, Ne approaches N d. variation in reproduction i. if k is the average number of gametes produced by a member of a popn, then vark is the variance Ne=(4N-2)/( vark+2) as the variance in reproductive success gets larger then random expectations, the Ne gets lower.\nby Dr. Michael Tobler\n\nEffective Population Size\nThe total population size (census population size) in natural populations is not the same as the effective population size (Ne), which is the size of the breeding population. Effective population size takes into consideration that many individuals that reach adulthood never breed in natural populations. Consequently, effective population size is almost always smaller than the census population size. Effective population size is particularly impacted by deviations from 1:1 sex ratios. In such cases, effective population size can be estimated as\n\\[\\begin{align}\nN_e = \\frac{4N_mN_f}{N_m+N_f} (\\#eq:24)\n\\end{align}\\]\nwhere Nm is the number of males and Nf the number of females. If you assume census population of 100 with equal sex ratio, Ne is 100. If you assume a sex ratio of 1:9, Ne drops to just 36. Distinguishing between N and Ne is important for conservation biology and many population genetic analyses related to genetic drift and inbreeding. For example, when Ne is significantly smaller than N, the probability of fixation of an allele in response to drift can be much higher than estimated by census population sizes.\n\n\n\n9.2.8 Founder effects\n\nnot quite what founder effects encompass in evolution\nwhen a population gets founded based on a small number of individuals, the allele freq in these founders can be very different from source due to sampling error alone\nsome degree of genetic differentiation between source and founding population is bound to occur\nestablishment of new population\n\ninstanteous evolution of differences bw new population and old population\nsee text page 167 for examples\n\nBesides sampling error, genetic drift can also have profound impacts on allele frequencies when there are rapid reductions in population size. In general, we distinguish between two scenarios: (1) Population bottlenecks occur when catastrophic events (large-scale wild fires, floods, etc.) drastically reduce the size of a population. In such instances, survival is less dependent on individuals’ traits (that would be selection) than individuals being in the right place at the right time. Hence, the allelic composition of the generation after a bottleneck largely reflects a random subsample of the original population. (2) Founder effects occur when a small subset of a population disperses into a new area and founds a new population. In that case, only a random subset of alleles travels along with the founding individuals. Founder effects are particularly important in island populations, where species expand their range in a step-wise fashion along island chains. This can lead to serial founder effects with continuous loss of genetic diversity (Figure @ref(fig:founder)).\n\n\n\n\n\nAllelic richness in populations of monarch butterflies (Danaus plexippus). The original population from the United States exhibits the highest levels of allelic richness. Allelic richness declined in a step-wise fashion as butterflies first colonized Hawaii and then other islands throughout the Pacific. Data from Pierce et al. (2014).",

    "section": "",
    "text": "10.1 The Effects of Selection\nRosemary and Peter Grant’s work has shown us how natural selection can drive rapid evolution of phenotypic traits. But what are the genetic ramifications of selection? How does selection impact genetic variation and allele frequencies at a particular locus? Per definition, we know that selection favors the success of certain genotypes over others; this is one way Hardy-Weinberg disequilibrium can be generated. It is this biased success of certain genotypes that ultimately causes allele frequency changes across generations. For example, if the fitness of an individual is contingent on the number of A alleles at a particular locus, we would expect the A allele to become more common than the a allele through successive generations.\nSuch allele frequency changes across generations are well documented from evolution experiments. For example, Dawson (1970) conducted research on flour beetles (Tribolium castaneum). In his colonies, he observed a recessive deleterious mutation, where individuals with two copies of the recessive allele (l) could not survive, but heterozygotes (wt/l) and individuals that were homozygous for the the wildtype (wt) allele had normal fitness. This represents a classical dominant-recessive inheritance. To test the evolutionary consequences of the deleterious recessive allele, Dawson assembled experimental populations composed solely of heterozygous individuals, which means that the allele frequencies of wt and l were both 0.5. He then let the populations evolve for several generations and measured the allele frequencies of wt and l in each generation. As you can see in Figure @ref(fig:recdel), the allele frequency of wt increased in each generation. Since p+q=1 for any biallelic locus, the frequency of l decreased concurrently. Hence, selection against the recessive lethal allele caused it to decline in frequency over time. This makes intuitive sense, considering the offspring of the heterozygous individuals of the initial population were 25 % wt/wt (p2), 50 % heterozygous wt/l (2pq), and 25 % l/l (q2). While all the individuals with at least one wt allele survived and reproduced, individuals that were homozygous for the recessive allele perished, disproportionately removing l alleles from the population.\nSelection against a deleterious recessive mutation causes significant changes in allele frequencies over short periods of time. Data from Dawson (1970).\nSimilar changes in allele frequencies can be observed if populations that are polymorphic at a particular locus are exposed to different environmental conditions. For example, many fruit fly (Drosophila melanogaster) populations are polymorphic at the Adh locus, which encodes alcohol dehydrogenase, the same enzyme that detoxifies ethanol in your liver after a fine glass of wine. The two alleles in fruit flies differ in the rate at which they process ethanol, including a fast allele (Adhf) and a slow allele (Adhs). Cavener and Clegg (1981) used populations with this polymorphism, letting different replicate populations evolve on media that contained alcohol, or in non-alcoholic control populations. While the control populations only exhibited minor fluctuations in allele frequencies across generations, the frequency of the Adhf allele significantly increased in populations exposed to ethanol (Figure @ref(fig:ethanol)). The difference in evolutionary trajectories can be explained by the fitness benefit the Adhf allele confers in different environments: when ethanol is present, having faster detoxification is clearly advantageous. But if there is no ethanol in the environment, it does not matter whether you can detoxify it faster or slower, and genetic variation at the Adh locus becomes neutral.\nAllele frequency changes at the Adh locus in ethanol-exposed and control populations. Allele frequencies change drastically in populations that are exposed to the critical source of selection, ethanol. Data from Cavener and Clegg (1981).\nEvidence for change in allele frequencies in response to selection does not just come from laboratory experiments, but also from natural populations where time series of the genotypic composition of populations are available. One of the most amazing data sets in recent years comes from over 540 whole or partial genome sequences that were obtained from fossilized human remains—some of which are almost 14,000 years old. This time series spans some major transitions in human evolution, including the advent of agriculture and correlated changes in human diets that occurred about 10,000 years ago. Around that time, humans also started to domesticate livestock for meat and milk production. Many of these changes represented novel sources of selection, especially the availability of milk as a dietary component past weaning and into adulthood. As much as mammals rely on milk for nutrition right after birth, this food source is not really available to any species after weaning. Accordingly, the production of lactase—the enzyme that mediates digestion of milk sugar (lactose)—stops after weaning, leaving adult mammals unable to digest lactose. Some of you may be familiar with that problem. Depending on your heritage, you may feel significant discomfort after eating dairy, because your body cannot handle the lactose (this is known as lactose intolerance). It turns out that lactose intolerance is prevalent in human populations that do not have a cultural history of using domesticated animals for milk production. This raises the question of how lactose tolerance evolved in populations that do have a history of dairy use. Analyses of ancient DNA indicated that alleles conferring lactose tolerance (also known as lactase persistence alleles) were virtually absent in human populations prior to the domestication of dairy animals (Figure @ref(fig:lactase)). In European populations with a history of dairy farming, lactase persistence alleles did not start to spread until about 5,000 years ago, matching the timeline of domestication. Overall, empirical evidence from experiments and natural systems indicates that selection can have profound impacts on allele frequencies even over relatively short time frames.\nAnalyses of ancient DNA indicates an increase in the frequency of lactase persistence alleles starting about 5,000 years ago. Different geographic regions are color-coded and the size of markers is proportional to the number of genomes used to infer allele frequences. Data from Marciniak & Perry (2017).",

    "text": "10.1.1 Frequency-Dependent Selection\nWhile evolution experiments usually create conditions where the direction and strength of selection remains constant, selection in natural populations often varies spatially or temporally. For example, fluctuating selection can be associated with environmental change, which was exemplified in Darwin’s finches, whose beaks can evolve to be larger or smaller dependent on the available food resources. A special case of fluctuating selection is frequency-dependent selection, where the fitness of a genotype depends on the genotypic composition of the population. We distinguish two types of frequency-dependency: positive and negative.\nIn positive frequency-dependent selection, the fitness of a genotype increases as it becomes more common in a population, and consequently, selection rapidly drives common alleles to fixation. Positive frequency-dependent selection plays a major role in the evolution of signaling traits, where the efficiency of a signal is dependent on the frequency of its use. Notable examples include the evolution of social signals, flower coloration for pollinator attraction, and warning signals that indicate danger or unpalatability.\nA great example of positive frequency-dependent selection includes selection on warning signals in toxic, South American butterflies of the genus Heliconius. Some Heliconius species exhibit extensive geographic variation in their warning colors, but different species in the same geographic region are often strikingly similar (Figure @ref(fig:heliconius)). This is because different species in the same region mimic each other, developing shared signals to deter predators. Similar signals mean that predators are more likely to recognize the pattern of unpalatability. This is similar to the independent evolution of yellow and black stripes in wasps, bees, and many other insects that signal danger.\n\n\n\n\n\nMimicry in Heliconius butterflies. Specimens in the same row belong to the same species (top: H. melpomene; bottom: H. erato). Specimens in the same column were collected in the same geographic region. Image from Meyer (2006), CC BY 2.5, via Wikimedia Commons\n\n\n\n\nChouteau et al. (2016) tested whether positive frequency-dependent selection could explain the evolution of mimicry in Heliconius butterflies. They used prey models and placed them in different Heliconius populations that varied in the relative frequencies of different warning colorations, predicting that the rate of predation would be low if models matched the common warning phenotype. Indeed, models that resembled rare morphs were much more likely to be attacked by predators than models that resembled the common morph (Figure @ref(fig:posfreqdep)). In other words, the more common a particular morph is, the less likely it is to succumb to a predator, and consequently, it will have a higher fitness compared to the rarer morphs. Over the course of multiple generations, such positive frequency dependent selection can generate the evolution of coordinated warning signals across species inhabiting the same region.\n\n\n\n\n\nPositive frequency dependent selection. Data from Chouteau et al. (2016).\n\n\n\n\nIn negative frequency-dependent selection, the fitness of a genotype declines as it becomes more common. Negative frequency-dependency is a mechanism by which genetic variation is maintained in a population, and it can be an important evolutionary force acting on a wide variety of traits. Perhaps most well-known is how negative frequency-dependence shapes the evolution of many traits associated with host-pathogen interactions. As certain host defense strategies become more common, pathogens rapidly evolve to adapt to those defenses. As a consequence, individuals with more common defense strategies exhibit lower fitness than rare ones, leading to fluctuations in genotype frequencies over time.\nAnother great example of negative frequency-dependent selection comes from the orchid Dactylorhiza sambucina, which exhibits a striking polymorphism in flower coloration (Figure @ref(fig:orchid)). While many plant communities are subject to positive frequency-dependent selection to coordinate signals for pollinator attraction, Dactylorhiza cheats: unlike most flowers, those of Dactylorhiza do not provide any rewards to pollinators in the form of nectar. As a consequence, pollinators learn to avoid Dactylorhiza flowers.\n\n\n\n\n\nDactylorhiza sambucina (yellow and purple/red forms growing together) in Andorra. Photo by Strobilomyces, CC BY-SA 3.0, via Wikimedia Commons.\n\n\n\n\nDactylorhiza’s counter-adaptation to this learned avoidance is a flower color polymorphism, which is thought to be maintained by negative frequency-dependent selection. The idea is that if one color morph gets too abundant and pollinators start avoiding it, then they simply switch to the rarer color morph that they do not associate with a lack of reward yet. If this was correct, the fitness of a color morph should decline with its frequency. Gigord et al. (2001) tested this idea by conducting an experiment where they varied the relative frequency of different color morphs and quantified reproductive success. As predicted, male reproductive success was negatively correlated with relative frequency of the morph (Figure @ref(fig:negfreqdep)), indicating a rare morph advantage that is characteristic for negative frequency-dependent selection.\n\n\n\n\n\nAs predicted by negative frequency-dependent selection, reproductive success in Dactyorhiza color morphs is negatively correlated with the frequency of the morph in the population.

    "section": "10.2 Modeling the Effects of Selection",
    "text": "10.2 Modeling the Effects of Selection\nWhile the consequences of selection in terms of changing allele frequencies may seem trivial at first sight, the exact outcome of selection actually depends on a number of parameters, including the starting allele frequency and the fitness distribution across different genotypes. To develop a nuanced understanding of alternative evolutionary outcomes in response to selection, we will use simple mathematical models to explore how different starting conditions shape evolutionary trajectories. In the following sections we will explore the conceptual background on how these mathematical models work. Then you will learn how you can easily run different models in lab.\n\n10.2.1 Relative Fitness\nModeling changes in allele frequencies in response to selection requires a modification of the formulas associated with the Hardy-Weinberg principle. When calculating allele frequencies across generations, we have to take into account fitness differences between the genotypes. While fitness is typically measured through a variety of proxies in natural populations (e.g., survival, reproductive success, growth, etc.), having species- or even study-specific metrics for fitness is not conducive to mathematical modeling. So, rather than considering different fitness components, we can just subsume different metrics into a single, idealized measure of fitness, which is called relative fitness. Relative fitness expresses the fitness of different genotypes relative to each other, and it can be any positive number, including zero. In practice, we choose one genotype as a reference and set its relative fitness to 1 (representing 100 % fitness). The fitness of other genotypes can then be expressed in relation to the reference. Fitness values are higher than the reference (&gt;1) if alternate genotypes have higher fitness and lower than the reference (&lt;1) if they have lower fitness. The difference in relative fitness between genotypes is called the selection coefficient (s), indicating how fitness and selection are directly related to each other.\n\n\n10.2.2 A generalized model for studying selection\nTo begin our exploration of selection, we will first develop a generalized model that will act the basis to conveniently explore the various ways selection can work. Assuming the following:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAssumptions of the population genetic models\n\n\n\n\ndiploid organism\nsexually reproducing\nsingle locus (gene) - call it the A gene\ntwo alleles segregating in the population designated \\(A_1\\) and \\(A_2\\)\n\nNOTE: Do not be confused by allele names. They are completely arbritrary for the most part. For example, if we are discussing two alleles at a gene, we can refer to them as \\(A_1\\) and \\(A_2\\), or \\(A\\) and \\(a\\), or \\(George\\) ad \\(Martha\\). It really does not matter. I prefer \\(A_1\\) and \\(A_2\\) for this discussion since it tends to sidestep any a priori assumption about dominant/recessive relationship between the alleles. I have found the concept of dominant/recessive relationship between the alleles to be a major stumbling point for many students, probably owing to the way genetics is first introduced via Mendel. We will discuss this idea a little later as we explore various models of selection. For now, consider both alleles are equally expressed, and therfore there is no dominant/recessive relationship\n\n\nReferring back to the chapter introducing evolutionary genetics and the HW equilibrium (Chapter 8), there are three possible genotypes in this model due to random mating within the populaton: \\(A_1A_1\\), \\(A_1A_2\\), and \\(A_2A_2\\), which under our null model (HW equil) will occur in the following frequences: \\(p^2\\), \\(2pq\\), and \\(q^2\\).\nSince we are modelling selection, we also need to include some measure of fitness, specifically a genotype-specific measure of relative fitness, which we will designate \\(W_{ii}\\) where the \\(ii\\) indicates any possible genotype. Because they are relative fitnesses, for our purposes we will define the fitness coefficients \\(W_{ii}\\) as ranging between \\(0\\longrightarrow1.0\\). As mentioned above, we could have just as easily randomly assigned any genotype as our reference such that you could have a genotypic fitness \\(W_{ii}&gt;1.0\\), but for reasons of clarity I prefer setting our favored genotype as our reference such that the \\(W_{ii}=0\\longrightarrow1.0\\).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGenotype specific fitness coefficients\n\n\n\nRecall our definition of fitness ?nte-fitness from the chater on how selection works. A good way to think about what these genotype fitness coefficients mean is what percentage of individual with a specific genotype survive and produce to the next generation. For example, if all the individuals in our sample of a particular genotype (e.g. \\(A_1A_1\\)) survive and reproduce, we would assign a genotype specific fitness to that genotype as \\(W_{11} = 1.0\\). If however, we were to specify that only 90% of the individuals with that genotype got to survive and reproduce, than the genotype specific fitness would be \\(W_{11} = 0.9\\).\nThese genotype specific fitness coefficients are obviously related to selection, so we define \\(s\\) as the selection coefficient such that\n\\(W = 1-s\\)\nAnother way to specify fitness coefficients then is as selection coefficients \\(s\\). As above, if we stated that 10% of the individual in our population failed to survive or reproduce, then when \\(s=0.10\\), \\(W_{ii} = 1-s = 0.9\\).\nThis is a concenient way to talk about the various types of selection, as you will see, and we will try to remain as consistent as possible using this way to discuss genotype specific fitness and selection coefficients throughout the rest of the this text.\n\n\nSummarizing as a table, under the above generalized conditions, we can now ask the question what happens to the allele frequencies when selection is acting on the genotypes? This leads to following table:\n\n\n\nTable 10.1: Generalized model for selection\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGenotype\n\\(A_1A_1\\)\n\\(A_1A_2\\)\n\\(A_2A_2\\)\nSum\n\n\n\n\nfreq \\(f_{ii}\\)\n\\(p^2\\)\n\\(2pq\\).\n\\(q^2\\)\n\\(1.0\\)\n\n\nfitness \\(W_{ii}\\)\n\\(W_{11}\\)\n\\(W_{12}\\)\n\\(W_{22}\\)\n\n\n\nfreq after selection\n\\(p^2W_{11}\\)\n\\(2pqW_{12}\\)\n\\(q^2W_{22}\\)\n\\(\\overline{W}\\)\n\n\nrelative freq\n\\(\\frac{p^2W_{11}}{\\overline{W}}\\)\n\\(\\frac{2pqW_{12}}{\\overline{W}}\\)\n\\(\\frac{q^2W_{22}}{\\overline{W}}\\)\n\\(1.0\\)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote that “freq \\(f_{ii}\\)” are the HWequil frequencies for each genotype, the genotype specific fitness values are in the row labeled “fitness \\(W_{ii}\\)”. To calculate the genotype frequencies after selection, we would simply multiply the frequency of the genotype by the genotype specific fitness coefficient, as indicated in row labeled “freq after selection”. If we sum up these genotype frequencies after selection, the sum does not equal 1.0 of course since we are selectively removing some indiduals of a specific genotype (there for sum would be \\(&lt;1.0\\)). However, if you have had a statistics course, you might notice that sum of the genotype frequencies after selection \\(p^2W_{11}+2pqW_{12}+q^2W_{22}\\) is how we can calculate an average, so we define:\n\\[\np^2W_{11}+2pqW_{12}+q^2W_{22}=\\overline{W}\n\\tag{10.1}\\]\nSince these are relative fitness’, we want the sum of the frequencies after selection to equal \\(1.0\\). To do this, we simply divide each gentype frequency after selection by the mean population fitness \\(\\overline{W}\\), as indicated on the last row of the table labeled “relative freq”:\n\\[\n\\frac{p^2W_{11}}{\\overline{W}} + \\frac{2pqW_{12}}{\\overline{W}} + \\frac{q^2W_{22}}{\\overline{W}} = \\frac{p^2W_{11}+2pqW_{12}+q^2W_{22}}{\\overline{W}}= 1.0\n\\tag{10.2}\\]\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nThe table above serve as our entry point to explore various models of selection, so take a few minutes to look over Table 10.1 and make sure you understand what the table is showing.\n\n\n\n\n10.2.3 Deriving a generalized equation for selection\nWe now have estimates of the relative genotype frequencies after selection as shown in Table 10.1. However, based on our definition of evolution, what we really want to know are the allele frequencies and whether they have changed or not. Since we have the genotype frequencies, we can easily calculate the allele frequencies using Equation 8.2 in the introduction to evolution genetics section. Substituting the values using the last row of Table 10.1 into Equation 8.2 and performing a little algebra:\n\\[\nf_{(A)}=f_{AA}+\\frac{1}{2}(f_{Aa})\n\\]\n\\[\nf_{(A)}=p'=\\frac{p^2W_{11}}{\\overline{W}}+\\frac{1}{2}(\\frac{2pqW_{12}}{\\overline{W}})=\\frac{(p^2W_{11}+pqW_{12})}{\\overline{W}}\n\\tag{10.3}\\]\nThe above equation tells us what the allele frequency for the \\(A\\) allele is in the next generation after selection. This is useful, but again we are interested in the change in allele frequency \\(\\Delta p\\), which is simply \\(\\Delta p = p'-p\\), where \\(p'\\) is from Equation 10.3.\n\\[\n\\Delta p = \\frac{(p^2W_{11}+pqW_{12})}{\\overline{W}}-p\n\\]\nAfter some more algebra which we will not show, the above equation is simplified to:\n\\[\n\\Delta p = \\frac{p}{\\overline{W}}(pW_{11}+qW_{12} - \\overline{W})\n\\tag{10.4}\\]\nThere are various other forms of this generalize equation, but I prefer this version (at this point anyway) because it allows us to make the following important observation. As with a lot of seemingly complicated equations, which can seem a little intimidating, the best way to make sense of them is to break them into smaller pieces and ask what happens when one part is larger than another. In this instance, ignore the \\(\\frac{p}{\\overline{W}}\\) for now. Inside the curly brackets, the term \\((pW_{11}+qW_{12})\\) is a weighted average, in this case the weighted average fitness for allele \\(A\\). The other term in the brackets is \\(\\overline{W}\\), the mean population fitness. Just focus on these two terms for now.\nWhat happens when the mean fitness of allele \\(A\\) is greater than the mean population fitness \\(\\overline{W}\\)? When \\((pW_{11}+qW_{12}) &gt; \\overline{W}\\), then \\(\\Delta p\\) will be positive: the frequency of allele \\(A\\) will increase in the population.\nWhen the mean fitness of allele \\(A\\) is less than the mean population fitness \\(\\overline{W}\\), then \\((pW_{11}+qW_{12}) &lt; \\overline{W}\\) and \\(\\Delta p\\) will be negative: the frequency of allele \\(A\\) will decrease in the population.\nThis is an important insight. What this is telling us is that in order for an allele to be favored and increase in frequency in a population, it just needs to be better on average than the mean population fitness. In other words, rewording this to reflect beyond genes and alleles, you do not need to be biggest, badest. or best out there, just just need to be better than average to be favored by selection. This is a profoundy different way to think about selection and fitness. It is relative to those around you. We mentioned this earlier in the chapter on the nature of natural selection, and here we have mathematical proof.\n\n\n10.2.4 A diversity of selection models\nIn terms of our discussion on selection, Equation 10.4 is very important in helping to explore how selection works when taking into account the relationship between the two alleles and their impact on the phenotype (fitness in this case). What we mean by this is, recalling your basic genetics from intro biology or BIO211 genetics, in a diploid organism with two alleles, there are two homozygous genotypes (\\(A_1A_1\\) and \\(A_2A_2\\)) and one heterozygous genotype \\(A_1A_2\\). In the heterozygous genotypes, the two different alleles can interact in such a way as to impact the phenotype (fitness) of the heterozygotes. You saw this with classic Mendelian genetics where Mendel used traits (like pea color) where one allele dominated over the other in the heterozygotes such that the heterozygotes could not be differentiated from one of the homozygotes. This is called a dominance-recessive relationship among alleles, and though not all alleles at different genes are either dominant or recessive (a mistake many students unfortunately make), many are.\nIt is essential that we understand how dominance/recessive, or a lack thereof, impacts the heterozygotes since according to Equation 10.4, that will impact what happens to the frequency of alleles in the next generation. When we talk about a diversity of selection models, this is one aspect of what we are talking about. We will be exploring what happens in the case of complete dominance, incomplete dominance, co-dominance, heterozygous advantage, and heterozygous disadvantage since each of these models will have important consequences to how selection works and the impact it has on changing allele frequencies over time.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat is dominance and recessive mean?\n\n\n\nBefore moving on to the different models, I have found that gaining a more nuanced understanding of dominance/recessive and the impacts on fitness of the heterozygotes really helps to appreciate the distinction among these models. So, before diving into the models, what is dominance; how do we define it?\nWe formally define dominance/recessive based on the impact on the phenotype (fitness here) in the heterozygote genotype. On a scale of phenotypic effects, if the heterozygote is half way between the two homozygotes, then there is no dominance/recessive relationship between the alleles. This is classically referred to as codominance, but I really dislike this term. Since neither allele dominates in the heterozygote expression of the phenotype, it is incorrect to even use the term in this situation.\nIf however the heterozygote expresses the phenotype somewhere between the two homozygote genotypes other than half way, then we have a dominance/recessive relationship between the alleles. If one allele is dominant, than the other must be recessive. Allele impacts on the genotype can be either advantageous, meaning they tend to increase fitness, or deleterious, meaning they have a negative impact on fitess. Complete dominance is when the heterozygote phenotype is exactly the same as one of the homozygotes. This was case with many of the characters Mendel worked with, and is fairly common in genomes (as best as we can tell).\nIf we assume additive effects of the allele interactions, then we can easily model the different patterns of dominance/recessive interactions by introducing a term designated \\(h\\) into our fitness coefficients. I am not sure what to call this term, but it is easy to remember: \\(h\\) implies impact on heterozygotes. \\(h\\) can range from \\(0\\longrightarrow1.0\\). Recalling from above that our fitness coefficients are related to selection by \\(W_{ii}=1-s\\), we can then modify this relationship to:\n\\(W_{12}=1-hs\\) with \\(h\\) ranging from \\(0\\longrightarrow1.0\\)\nThis simple addition allows us to model all the possible dominance/recessive - advantageous/deleterious relationships of alleles in the heterozygotes.\n\n\n\n\\(h\\)\nrelationship of alleles\n\n\n\n\n\\(0\\)\ncomplete dominance advantageous allele\n\n\n\\(0&lt;h&lt;0.5\\)\nincomplete dominance advantageous allele\n\n\n\\(0.5\\)\ncodominance (neither allele is dominant or recessive)\n\n\n\\(0.5&lt;h&lt;1.0\\)\nincomplete dominance deleterious allele\n\n\n\\(1\\)\ncomplete dominance deleterious allele\n\n\n\nGraphically:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 10.1: Graphical view of dominance/recessive relationships among alleles. The x-axis is the phenotypic value of the character, which in our case is fitness. The two homozygous genotypes mark the extremes of the x-axis, with the value of the heterozygote varying depending on the value of \\(W_{12} = 1-hs\\). Note that for the cases of incomplete dominance, \\(h\\) can have a rage of values.\n\n\n\nThere are a couple of reasons for focusing so much on this concept of dominance/recessive. First, in my experience many students get stuck into the idea that all allele relationships are dominant/recessive. I think it is the way genetics is taught early on in their biology education, with a focus on Mendel. True, many of Mendel’s characters were dominate/recessive, but that was either a coincidence or purposeful on his part. And though the evidence suggests that many genes have alleles segregating in a population that have a dominance/recessive relationship (recall the ABO blood group in humans), many also do not (again, ABO). Having a clear understanding of domiance/recessive reltionships and using the language of dominance only when warrated, it will prevent a lot of misunderstanding later on.\nThe second important reason for focusing on this concept is that the allele interactions in the heterozygote will have a profound impact on how selection acts to change the frequency of alleles in a population over time. These are models we will be reviewing next, so again best to have a solid understanding before diving into the various models.\n\n\nWe are now in a good position to introduce the various models we will be exploring. We develop the equations for each of the various models by defining the genotype specific fitness coefficients for each genotype, referred to as the fitness array. The table below lists the various models with their associated fitness arrays for the models we will be exploring.\n\nVarious selection models we will explore in lab. Note that the relative genotype specific fitness values are specified as selection coefficients (\\(s\\)), recalling \\(W_{ii} = 1-s\\).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGenotype\n\\(A_1A_1\\)\n\\(A_1A_2\\)\n\\(A_2A_2\\)\nModel\n\n\n\n\n\n\\(1\\)\n\\(1\\)\n\\(1-s\\)\nPure Dominance: advantageous dominant\n\n\n\n\\(1\\)\n\\(1-s\\)\n\\(1-s\\)\nPure Dominance: deleterious dominant\n\n\n\n\\(1\\)\n\\(1-hs\\)\n\\(1-s\\)\nIncomplete dominance (\\(0 &lt; h &lt; 1\\))\n\n\n\n\\(1\\)\n\\(1-0.5s\\)\n\\(1-s\\)\nCodominance (\\(h=0.5\\))\n\n\n\n\\(1-s\\)\n\\(1\\)\n\\(1-t\\)\nHeterozygote advantage\n\n\n\n\\(1\\)\n\\(1-s\\)\n\\(1\\)\nHeterozygote disadvantage\n\n\n\nBy replacing the fitness coefficients with the selection coefficients, we can then plug the selection values into Equation 10.4, do a lot of math, and eventually derive an equation that defines how the frequency of alleles will change over time given a model of selection. We will not go over any of the derivations, though we certainly can explore these if you are interested. Rather, our approach will be to focus on undertanding the models themselves, make casual mention to the final equations for each, but use a simulation program in lab to explore the consequences of each model.\nThe derived equations for the models above are shown in the following table.\n\nTable of deterministic equations for the various selection models considered.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nModel\n\\(A_1A_1\\) \\(p^2\\) \\(W_{11}\\)\n\\(A_1A_2\\) \\(2pq\\) \\(W_{12}\\)\n\\(A_2A_2\\) \\(q^2\\) \\(W_{22}\\)\nDeterministic equations\n\n\n\n\nAdvantageous dominant deletereous recessive \\((W_{11}=W_{12}&gt;W_{22})\\)\n\\(1\\)\n\\(1\\)\n\\(1-s\\)\n\\(\\Delta p=\\frac{spq^2}{1-sq^2}\\)\n\\(\\Delta q=\\frac{-spq^2}{1-sq^2}\\)\n\n\nAdditive fitness: advantageous partially dominant \\((W_{11}&gt;W_{12}&gt;W_{22})\\)\n\\(1\\)\n\\(1-hs\\)\n\\(0&lt;h&lt;1\\)\n\\(1-s\\)\n\\(\\Delta p=\\frac{spq}{2(1-sq)}\\)\n\n\nHeterozygote advantage \\((W_{11}&lt;W_{12}&gt;W_{22})\\)\n\\(1-s\\)\n\\(1\\)\n\\(1-t\\)\n\\(\\Delta p=\\frac{pq(-sp+tq)}{(1-sq^2-tq^2)}\\)\n\\(\\hat{p}=\\frac{t}{(s+t)}\\)\n\n\nHeterozygote disadvantage \\((W_{11}&gt;W_{12}&lt;W_{22})\\)\n\\(1\\)\n\\(1+s\\)\n\\(1-s\\)\n\\(1\\)\n\\(1\\)\n\\(1+t\\)\n\\(\\Delta p=\\frac{pq(sp-tq)}{(1+sq^2+tq^2)}\\) |",

    "text": "12.1 Migration: The Homogenizing Force\nOur view of evolutionary processes so far has assumed that populations are relatively homogenous, with random mating among all individuals contained within (i.e., panmixia). More often than not, however, species consist of many populations that inhabit suitable habitat patches and are separated by less favorable environmental conditions (Figure @ref(fig:popstructure)A-B). Such partial isolation can cause differentiation among populations, either because genetic drift impacts allele frequencies differently across populations, or because variation in environmental conditions among populations favors different genotypes. But despite some degree of isolation, populations within a species are typically connected through migration. Migration can be unidirectional or bidirectional, and can vary in strength (i.e., the number of migrating individuals relative to the population size). Migration rates are typically higher between proximate populations than between populations that are far apart—a phenomenon known as isolation by distance.\nA. Species are often assumed to be relatively homogenous units with panmixia. B. However, species can also consist of structured populations that are somewhat differentiated but still connected by migration. Variation in color indicates population differentiation; arrows represent patterns of migration among populations. C. Schematic of the one-island migration model.\nMigration is an evolutionary force because it can impact the genetic composition of populations. Migrants may carry novel alleles from one population to another, acting similar to mutation in terms of introducing new genetic variation. Even in absence of novel alleles, migration between differentiated population causes changes in allele frequencies. In the absence of other evolutionary forces, it homogenizes the genetic composition of different populations. To illustrate this, let’s consider a simple scenario known as the one-island migration model (Figure @ref(fig:popstructure)C). The model assumes two populations: a large mainland population and a small island population. Even if the number of individuals migrating in either direction is the same, the input of island individuals arriving in the mainland population is negligible because of its large size. In contrast, because of the small island population, individuals from the mainland arriving on the island can significantly impact allele frequencies, if allele frequencies differ between populations. In this case, island allele frequencies after a migration event (pi’) can be described as a function of island allele frequencies before a migration event (pi), mainland allele frequencies (pm), and the migration rate (m):\n\\[\\begin{align}\np_i' = (1-m)p_i+mp_m (\\#eq:28) \\\\\n𝚫p_i=p_i'-p_i=m(p_m-p_i) (\\#eq:29)\n\\end{align}\\]\nApplying Equation @ref(eq:28) and calculating island allele frequencies across multiple generations reveals the genetic effect of migration (Figure @ref(fig:migfig)): migration from the mainland to the island changes pi until it is equal to pm, and the rate of migration dictates the speed at which this conversion happens. In other words, migration homogenizes the allele frequencies across populations.\nWarning in geom_text(aes(0, pm, label = \"p (mainland)\"), vjust = 1.5, hjust = 0): All aesthetics have length 1, but the data has 400 rows.\nℹ Please consider using `annotate()` or provide this layer with data containing\n  a single row.\n\n\n\n\n\nMigration between a mainland and an island population homogenizes allele frequencies over time. The higher the migration rate, the faster the rate of homogenization. The simulations above were based on the starting allele frequencies of pm0=0.05 and pi0=0.95, and a range of migration rates (m).

Hence, human-facilitated migration is sometimes used as a tool in conservation biology, where new individuals are introduced into populations of endangered species suffering from low genetic diversity and inbreeding. This practice is also known as genetic rescue. In many instances, however, migration actually counteracts the effects of selection. Imagine two adjacent populations that are exposed to different environmental conditions. In every generation, selection favors alleles that mediate adaptation to the local conditions. But if there is migration between the two populations, new maladaptive alleles are continuously introduced from the other population. Hence, migration can prevent local adaptation of populations. Adaptive divergence between populations is only possible if the effect of divergent selection is stronger than the homogenizing force of migration (Figure @ref(fig:migsel)).\n\n\n\n\n\nResults of a combined simulation of drift, selection, and migration. The optimal allele frequency for population 1 (red) is p=1, and the optimal frequency for population 2 (blue) is p=0. The two models ran were identical except for the migration rate between the two populations. As you can see, populations approach their respective optimal allele frequencies when migration rates are low (left graph). In contrast, higher migration rates continuously homogenize allele frequencies across the populations, and accordingly allele frequencies hover around p=0.5 (right graph).\n\n\n\n\nEvidence for the tension between selection and migration is also observed in natural populations. Remember the stick insects of the genus Timema that we got to know in Chapter 2? As you might recall, different populations of T. cristinae are adapting to different host plants—either broad-leafed species of the genus Ceanothus or needle-leafed species of the genus Adenostoma. Populations adapted to Ceanothus are uniformly colored for optimal camouflage; those adapted to Adenostoma exhibit a dorsal stripe to mimic the needle-like leaves (see Figure 2.4). If selection was the only evolutionary force, we would expect the optimal phenotype to eventually become fixed in each population. However, both color forms tend to be present in many T. cristinae populations, and the maladaptive morph can even be more common than the adaptive one. Bolnick and Nosil (2007) were able to show that the high frequency of maladaptive morphs is likely a consequence of migration. If neighboring populations adapted to the opposite host are relatively small, with few migrants arriving in a population, selection is able to keep maladaptive morphs at a low frequency (Figure @ref(fig:timema2)). However, when neighboring populations are large and provide a source of many migrating individuals, the frequency of maladaptive morphs can be very high due to continuous reintroduction (Figure @ref(fig:timema2)).\n\n\n\n\n\nThe frequency of maladaptive morphs in Timema stick insects adapted to different plant hosts (Ceanothus and Adenostoma) is directly related to the size of neighboring populations that are a source of migrating individuals. Data from Bolnick & Nosil (2007).",

    "section": "12.2 Non-Random Mating: Not Much of a Force",
    "text": "12.2 Non-Random Mating: Not Much of a Force\nThe last evolutionary force that we need to discuss is non-random mating. Non-random mating occurs when the probability that two individuals in a population will mate is not the same for all possible combinations of genotypes. Non-random mating can be assortative, when individuals are more likely to mate with similar individuals (e.g., individuals having the same genotype or phenotype), or it can be disassortative, when individuals prefer to mate with dissimilar individuals. Technically speaking, non-random mating is not an evolutionary force, because—unlike mutation, selection, drift, and migration—it does not actually cause any change in allele frequencies across generations. It does, however, cause deviations from Hardy-Weinberg assumptions, because the frequency of genotypes do not match Hardy-Weinberg predictions when non-random mating is present. Therefore, non-random mating can have some indirect consequences for evolution.\nOne of the most common forms of non-random mating is inbreeding, where offspring are produced by individuals that are closely related. The epitome of inbreeding is selfing (self-fertilization), which essentially represents strict genotype-specific assortative mating and is particularly common in plants. If we assume a single, biallelic locus A, possible matings during selfing include AA x AA, Aa x Aa, and aa x aa. The consequences of selfing on the genotype frequencies across generations are depicted in Figure @ref(fig:selfing). As you can see, the frequency of heterozygotes declines rapidly until they are virtually gone after just 10 generations. This is because neither the self-crosses of AA and aa yield any heterozygotes, and self-crosses of Aa yield 50 % homozygotes. Accordingly, the frequency of heterozygotes is halved in every generation.\n\n\n\n\n\nChanges in genotype frequencies across generations when all individuals in a population self-fertilize.\n\n\n\n\nThe degree of inbreeding can be described by the coefficient of inbreeding (F), which calculates the probability that two copies of an allele have been inherited from an ancestor common to both the mother and the father. You can find some examples for inbreeding coefficients in Table 6.1. Once we know F for a population, we can account for the effects of inbreeding on genotype frequencies by modifying the original Hardy-Weinberg formulas:\n\\[\\begin{align}\nf_{AA} = p^2(1-F)+pF (\\#eq:30) \\\\\nf_{Aa} = 2pq(1-F) (\\#eq:31) \\\\\nf_{aa} = q^2(1-F)+qF (\\#eq:32)\n\\end{align}\\]\nSimilarly, we can calculate the heterozygosity after inbreeding (H’) based on F and the heterozygosity under Hardy-Weinberg assumptions (H0):\n\\[\\begin{align}\nH' = H_0(1-F) (\\#eq:33)\n\\end{align}\\]\n\nExpected and Observed Heterozygosity\nHeterozygosity is a measure of genetic variability in a population. While there are multiple metrics of heterozygosity, the most commonly used one is expected heterozygosity HE (also known as gene diversity, D). For a single locus with k alleles, expected heterozygosity is defined as:\n\\[\\begin{align}\nH_E = 1-\\sum_{i=1}^k p_i^2 (\\#eq:34)\n\\end{align}\\]\nHence, for a bi-allelic locus with allele frequencies p and q, expected heterozygosity is:\n\\[\\begin{align}\nH_E = 1-(p^2 + q^2) (\\#eq:35)\n\\end{align}\\]\nHE can range from zero (when a population is fixed for a single allele) to almost 1 (when a locus has a large number of alleles with the same frequency). In practice, we can apply expected heterozygosity as a null model for inbreeding. Based on population level genotype data, we can calculate observed heterozygosity (HO) and allele frequencies, which allow us to also calculate expected heterozygosity (HE). If HE=HO, the observed heterozygosity matches the theoretical predictions, meaning that all Hardy-Weinberg assumptions are met. If HE≠HO, some evolutionary force must be acting on the particular locus. Most commonly, HE&gt;&gt;HO can be an indicator of inbreeding in a population.\nThe degree of inbreeding is often quantified based on many loci in the genome, not just one. For m loci, genome-wide heterozygosity (F) is:\n\\[\\begin{align}\nF = 1-\\frac{1}{m} \\sum_{l=1}^m \\sum_{i=1}^k p_i^2 (\\#eq:36)\n\\end{align}\\]\n\nEquation @ref(eq:33) allows us to simulate the effects of different levels of inbreeding on the observed heterozygosity across successive generations. As you can see in Figure @ref(fig:hetsim), the rate of decline in heterozygosity across generations is dependent on F, and declines can be rapid when inbreeding is common. Declines in heterozygosity are particularly common in small populations where the pool of potential partners is limited, inadvertently leading to mating between related individuals. This is also the case for many managed populations, including those associated with captive breeding programs for endangered species. Hence, many species maintenance programs strategically share individuals for breeding across institutions to avoid inbreeding.\n\n\n\n\n\nRates of decline in heterozygosity for different levels of inbreeding described by F (also see Table 6.1).\n\n\n\n\n\n12.2.1 Interactions between Inbreeding and Selection\nIf inbreeding is not really an evolutionary force, why is it important? Why is problematic for conservation and animal breeding? The excess of homozygotes generated by inbreeding increases the probability that individuals are homozygous for recessive deleterious alleles. As you know from simulations of selection, recessive deleterious alleles are usually rare; hence, matings that lead to individuals with two copies of recessive deleterious alleles are very unlikely (q2). That changes when inbreeding becomes common in a population. Along with negative fitness consequences for the individual, the increased probability of combining deleterious recessive alleles also reduces the average fitness in a population, which can be problematic for endangered species. Due to the costs associated with inbreeding, many species have evolved mechanisms for inbreeding avoidance, including disassortative mate choice or matrilineal group-living where male offspring are ostracized before they reach sexual maturity.\nEvidence for the negative consequences of inbreeding comes from humans as well as natural populations of plants and animals. In humans, the centuries-long practice of royal intermarriage in Europe—with frequent marriages even between first cousins—led to a high prevalence of hemophilia in royal families. In addition, the health issues of Spain’s King Charles II are widely thought to be the consequence of inbreeding.\n\nExplore More\nIf you are interested in learning more about inbreeding in the royal families of Europe, check out the article “The Dangers of Royal Inbreeding” by Charlie Evans.\n\nIn natural populations, evidence for inbreeding comes from feral sheep on the island of Soay, off the coast of Scotland (Figure @ref(fig:soay)). The island is about 250 acres, and over the years the sheep population has fluctuated between 290 and 680 individuals. Extensive ecological and genetic studies of the Soay sheep population have shown interactions between inbreeding and selection. Survival of sheep on the island is density-dependent, with reduced survivorship at higher densities (Figure @ref(fig:inreedingsheep)). In addition, there is evidence for low to moderate rates of inbreeding the sheep population (Figure @ref(fig:inreedingsheep)). Putting together the data on density-dependent survivorship and inbreeding reveals an interesting pattern: at low densities (when competition is comparatively low), the impact of inbreeding on survival is relatively low. However, at medium and high densities, inbred individuals have reduced survivorship (Figure @ref(fig:inreedingsheep)). This data shows how even relatively low rates of inbreeding can impact individual fitness, although the consequences are dependent on environmental context.\n\n\n\n\n\nA male Soay sheep (Ovis aries).

Survival of sheep is strongly density dependent, as indicated by the lower average survival of individuals at medium and high densities (right graph).

Finally, survival at medium and high densities depends on the degree of inbreeding (left graph).

The spotted vs. melanistic forms of leopards, the round vs. wrinkled skin in peas, and the ABO blood groups in humans are all examples of qualitative traits. Many qualitative traits are controlled by variation at a single locus, but multiple loci can be involved when there are epistatic interactions. Epistasis describes the phenomenon where the effect of a gene is dependent on the effect of one or more modifier genes. For example, coat color variation in many mammals (including yellow, chocolate, and black Labrador retrievers) is dependent on both the ability of an individual to produce a particular color pigment (controlled by the B locus in Figure @ref(fig:epistasis)) and the ability of an individual to deposit pigments in relevant tissues (controlled by the A locus). Variation at the B locus that determines brown vs. black phenotype has no effect on coat color unless an individual also inherits the ability to deposit pigment; otherwise the coat color is just white. Epistatic interactions can profoundly impact evolutionary dynamics at single loci and cause deviations from the predictions of the simple inhertance models that we have used so far.\nExample of epistasis in coat color genetics: If no pigments can be deposited, the other coat color genes have no effect on color expression, no matter if they would be dominant or recessive, and no matter if the individual is homozygous.",

    "section": "13.2 Quantitative Traits: a Product of Genes and Environment",
    "text": "13.2 Quantitative Traits: a Product of Genes and Environment\nQuantitative traits vary continuously among individuals—for example, body size, thermal tolerance, and skin coloration in humans. The expression of quantitative traits depends on the cumulative action of many genes, which is why they are also referred to as polygenic traits. Quantitative traits are normally distributed within a population; most individuals exhibit an intermediate phenotype, and individuals with extreme trait values are more rare.\nThe normal distribution of quantitative traits is caused by the joint action of many genes with additive genetic effects. The continuous variation can be revealed using a simple F2-crossing experiment that is frequently used in quantitative genetics analyses (see QTL mapping below). If we cross two individuals from either extreme of a distribution (i.e., the shortest and the tallest, the lightest and the darkest, or the slowest and the fastest), the resulting F1 offspring should be phenotypically homogenous and intermediate to their parents, because the F1 individuals will be heterozygous at all loci involved in the expression of the quantitative trait. If we then cross two F1 individuals to produce an F2 generation, we not only recover the extremes of the distribution (i.e., the parental phenotypes), but the entire spectrum of phenotypic variants in between. The gradation of intermediate phenotypes is dependent on the number of loci controlling a quantitative trait. If a trait is controlled by a single locus with additive alleles, there are three phenotypic categories (e.g., short, medium, and tall; Figure (ref?)(fig:qualquan), left panel). If two loci are involved, trait expression is the sum of the effects of all individual alleles across both loci. In other words, how tall an individual grows is simply a function of the number of “tall” alleles it inherits across all loci. An intermediate size can be achieved by having two “tall” alleles at one locus (AAbb or aaBB) or one “tall” allele at each of the loci (AaBb). As a consequence, there are more offspring of intermediate size than small or large ones (Figure (ref?)(fig:qualquan), central panel). The more genes are involved in the expression of a particular phenotype, the narrower phenotypic categories become, and the more continuously distributed a trait is (Figure (ref?)(fig:qualquan), right panel).\n\n\n\n\n\nPhenotypes in F2 crosses are normally distributed if all alleles have additive effects. These three graphs show how the number of phenotypic categories increases as a function of the number genes involved in the expression of a particular trait.\n\n\n\n\nThe expression of quantitative traits can also be affected by the environment an individual finds itself in. The ability of a genotype tp produce multiple phenotypes depending on the environment is called phenotypic plasticity. In some species, phenotypic traits show phenomenal malleability in response to specific environmental cues that shape organismal development. For example, some anuran tadpoles develop alternative morphological traits depending on their exposure to predator cues early in development (Figure @ref(fig:rana)). Therefore, population differences in phenotypic traits are not always a consequence of evolutionary divergence and adaptation. Rather, individuals in different populations may express different traits simply due to different environmental exposure. For example, the Alpine plant Arabis alpina is distributed across a broad elevational gradient, ranging from 800 to 3,000+ meters above sea level. Individuals from high elevation populations tend to be smaller and produce less fruit. However, common garden experiments—where families were split and raised at different elevations—revealed that population differences in most traits were largely due to phenotypic plasticity (Figure @ref(fig:plastarabis); de Villemereuil et al. 2018). Hence, the expression of quantitative traits can be more dependent on the environmental context than the genetic information inherited from the parents.\n\nDefinition: Phenotypic Plasticity\nPhenotypic plasticity is the ability of a genotype to express different phenotypes. It can result in organisms changing their traits in response to stimuli or input from the environment.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhenotypic plasticity in Rana pirica tadpoles when under predation from salamander larvae: normal (left) and defended (right) morphs. Mori et al. (2009), CC BY 3.0, via Wikimedia Commons.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhenotypic plasticity in Arabis alpina. The graph shows mean trait values for different populations (in different colors) that were either grown at low or high elevation. Each population was composed of multiple families that were represented at both locations. Differences between locations are more pronounced than differences among populations, indicating the influence of environmentally-dependent phenotypic plasticity. Data from de Villemereuil et al. (2018).\n\n\n\n\nThe evolutionary analysis of quantitative traits has two complications: (1) Since many genes are involved in the expression of quantitative traits, it is not usually practical to follow changes in allele frequencies at relevant loci. Even worse, due to the large number of loci that often have small individual effects, even the identification of genes contributing to the expression of quantitative traits can be challenging. (2) We must be able to account for the potential effects of environmental variation on individual trait expression. Trait heritability is a key requirement for evolution by natural selection, but expressed traits may not be heritable if they were shaped by environmental effects. In the following section, we will explore two general approaches used to study the evolution of quantitative traits. One approach is agnostic about the genetic basis of quantitative traits but focuses on predicting the effects of selection on them. The other approach allows for the identification of the genetic basis of quantitative traits involved in adaptation.",

    "section": "13.3 Quantitative Trait Evolution",
    "text": "13.3 Quantitative Trait Evolution\nA key complication in the analysis of quantitative traits is the difficulty of identifying the genes involved in phenotypic expression. However, we can conduct meaningful analyses of quantitative trait evolution without diving into the details of the underlying genetics. We can predict the evolutionary response of a quantitative trait as a function of its heritability and the strength of selection. In this section, we will discuss how to quantify trait heritability and the strength of selection, and then how to apply the breeder’s equation to predict evolutionary change.\n\n13.3.1 Quantifying Trait Heritability\nGenerally, heritability measures the degree to which variation in a phenotypic trait in a population is due to genetic variation among individuals, rather than non-heritable factors like phenotypic plasticity. Specifically, broad sense heritability is defined as:\n\\[\\begin{align}\n\\frac{V_G}{V_P} (\\#eq:38)\n\\end{align}\\]\nwhere VG is genetic variation and VP is phenotypic variation. Since phenotypic variation among individuals is a consequence of genetic and environmental variation (VE), broad sense heritability can also be defined as:\n\\[\\begin{align}\n\\frac{V_G}{V_G+V_E} (\\#eq:39)\n\\end{align}\\]\nBroad-sense heritability describes the degree of genetic determination in the variation of a trait, and it can range from 0 (no genetic effects) to 1 (no environmental effects). It is important to note that measures of heritability are a population-level metric. We cannot disentangle the degree to which genes and environmental influences have shaped trait expression in a particular individual. Rather, we have to consider populations of individuals to determine what proportion of variation is shaped by genetic variation and what proportion is shaped by environmental variation.\nAs you learned in Chapter 3, heritability can be estimated by the slope of a regression between parental and offspring traits. If the slope of that regression is close to zero, parental trait expression is a poor predictor of offspring trait expression; hence, variation in the trait is primarily due to environmental and not genetic variation (Figure @ref(fig:herito)A). If, on the other hand, the slope of the parent-offspring regression is close to 1, the parental trait strongly predicts offspring trait expression, and variation in the traits is primarily driven by genetic variation (Figure @ref(fig:herito)C). Slopes between 0 and 1 describe the relative contribution of genetic and environmental variation to phenotypic variation in a population (Figure @ref(fig:herito)B).\n\n\n\n\n\nParent-offspring regressions reveal the degree of heritability in quantitative traits. A slope of zero indicates no heritability; a slope of 1 indicates perfect heritability. Slopes in between those values describe the relative contributions of genetic and environmental variation on phenotypic variation.\n\n\n\n\nIt is important to note that estimating heritability through parent-offspring regression represents narrow-sense heritability (h2), not broad-sense heritability . Broad- and narrow-sense heritability consider different aspects of genetic variation. Genetic variation (VG) is a composite of additive genetic variation (VA) and genetic variation caused by gene interactions, such as dominance (VD) and epistasis (VI). The slope of a parent-offspring correlation specifically quantifies the contribution of additive genetic variation to the observed phenotypic variation, such that narrow sense heritability is defined as:\n\\[\\begin{align}\nh^2 = \\frac{V_A}{V_P}=\\frac{V_A}{V_A+V_D+V_I+V_E} (\\#eq:40)\n\\end{align}\\]\nHence, narrow-sense heritability only considers the additive portion of adaptive variation; genetic variation associated with dominance and epistasis are ignored. This is useful because the phenotypic response to selection on a quantitative trait depends on VA and not VD. In addition, non-additive genetic effects are comparatively rare, and VA is much larger than VD and VI for most quantitative traits (Hill et al. 2008).\n\n\n13.3.2 Quantifying the Strength of Selection\nThe second step in quantitative genetic analyses is to infer the strength of selection on a focal trait, which can be measured as either the selection differential (S) or the selection gradient (m). The selection differential is the difference between the mean trait value of the selected (successful) individuals (T*) and the mean trait value of all individuals in a population (T’). Imagine a population of individuals that vary in a particular trait, as described in Figure @ref(fig:seldiffgrad)A. Some individuals survive to adulthood and reproduce (depicted in green), some perish early and have no reproductive success (depicted in red). The difference between the average trait value of the successful individuals and the average of all individuals is the selection differential. Note that if more individuals with smaller trait values were successful, the selection differential would shrink. If only individuals with smaller trait values were successful, the selection differential would become negative. Also note that the unit of the selection differential for a particular trait is the same as the unit used to quantify variation in that trait.\nThe second measure of the strength of selection on quantitative traits—the selection gradient—is more complicated, but has broader applicability, especially when fitness is measured quantitatively rather than qualitatively. The first step is to convert measurements of absolute fitness to measures of relative fitness. This can be accomplished by dividing every individual’s absolute fitness by the average fitness of the population. Using the same example as in Figure @ref(fig:seldiffgrad), we had 27 successful individuals (fitness of 1) and 73 unsuccessful individuals (fitness of zero). Hence, the average fitness in the population is 0.27 [27/(27+73)], which means that the relative fitness of successful individuals is ~3.7 (1/0.27). The relative fitness of unsuccessful individuals is of course still 0 (0/0.27). We can now plot relative fitness as a function of individual trait values. The selection gradient is the slope of the regression line between trait value and relative fitness (Figure @ref(fig:seldiffgrad)B).\nWhile the selection differential and the selection gradient may seem unrelated to each other, the two measures can actually be converted:\n\\[\\begin{align}\nm=\\frac{S}{var(T)} \\iff S=m*var(T) (\\#eq:41)\n\\end{align}\\]\nwhereas var(T) is the variance in the trait under consideration. In practice, if the strength of selection in quantitative genetic analyses is quantified using the selection gradient, it has to be converted to the selection differential, because the response to selection is proportional to S.\n\n\n\n\n\nA. Graphical representation of the selection differential (S), which is the difference between the selected individuals (*T**) and all individuals in the population (T’). The gray triangle represents the average trait value of all individuals, and the green triangle the average of all the successful individuals. The distance between the two is the selection differential. B. Graphical representation of the selection gradient (m). The selection gradient is the slope of the best-fit line between individual trait values and relative fitness.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n13.3.3 Calculating the Response to Selection\nThe final step in quantitative genetic analyses is to calculate the response to selection (R) as a function of narrow-sense heritability (h2) and the selection differential (S) using the breeder’s equation:\n\\[\\begin{align}\nR=h^2*S (\\#eq:42)\n\\end{align}\\]\nAs you can see, the response to selection is dependent equally on the strength of selection and the degree to which a particular trait is heritable. If selection is weak, the evolutionary response will be small even when trait heritability is very high. Similarly, when heritability is low, the evolutionary response will be small even when selection is very strong. The principle of the breeder’s equation is also depicted in Figure @ref(fig:breeder), a modified version of a parent-offspring regression. In this graph, successful parents are represented in green, and unsuccessful ones in red. As in Figure @ref(fig:seldiffgrad)A, the selection differential (S) is the difference between the average trait of the successful parents and the average trait of all parents in the population. The response to selection (R) is the difference between the average trait of the successful offspring and the average trait of all offspring in the population. Or, expressed mathematically:\n\\[\\begin{align}\nh^2=\\frac{R}{S}=\\frac{O^*-\\overline{O}}{P^*-\\overline{P}} (\\#eq:43)\n\\end{align}\\]\nYou can imagine how R will increase in this example as the slope of the best-fit line increases, reaching S when h2 equals 1. Similarly, R will decrease as you imagine the slope of the regression line decreasing, eventually reaching 0 when h2 equals 0.\nUltimately, the response to selection represents the per generation change in the average value of a population’s quantitative trait. Like the selection differential, it is measured in the same unit used to quantify trait variation. Together, the quantification of narrow-sense heritability, the selection differential, and the application of the breeder’s equation provide a critical tool for studying the evolution of polygenic traits, without the need to identify genes underlying phenotypic trait expression.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe response to selection (R) is proportional to the product of th selection differential (S) and narrow-sense heritability (as indicated by the slope of the best-fit line).",

    "section": "13.4 Modes of Selection on Quantitative Traits",
    "text": "13.4 Modes of Selection on Quantitative Traits\nIn our consideration of quantitative trait evolution, we have assumed that individuals at one end of the phenotypic spectrum exhibit a fitness advantage over individuals at the other end of the phenotypic spectrum. However, fitness functions can have any shape. In this section, we discuss three modes of selection on quantitative traits and contrast their impact on phenotypic variation across generations.\n\n13.4.1 Directional Selection\nUnder directional selection, fitness continuously increases (or decreases) with the value of a trait; hence, extreme phenotypes at one end of the spectrum have a fitness advantage over individuals at the other end of the spectrum. Fitness functions describing directional selection are often assumed to be linear (Figure @ref(fig:dirsel)), but in practice, nonlinear relationships (i.e., accelerating or decelerating curves) can also describe fitness variation under directional selection. The consequence of directional selection is an increase (or decrease) in the average trait value of the population (Figure @ref(fig:dirsel)). In addition, directional selection leads to a slight decrease in trait variation across generations. We have already learned about many examples of directional selection throughout the semester. The change in beak size of Darwin’s finches during the drought was a consequence of directional selection, just as decrease in eye size in some cave fish populations.\n\n\n\n\n\nUnder directional selection, individuals at one end of the phenotypic spectrum have a fitness advantage over individuals at the other end of the phenotypic spectrum. As a consequence, trait distributions after selection exhibit a higher mean (red triange) and slightly reduced variation (red bar).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n13.4.2 Stabilizing Selection\nUnder stabilizing selection, individuals with intermediate traits have the highest fitness, while individuals with extreme trait values have a selective disadvantage. Consequently, fitness functions under stabilizing selection have some sort of a hump-shaped curve (Figure @ref(fig:stabsel)). Unlike directional selection, stabilizing selection does not lead to changes in the average trait value in a population. However, it reduces trait variation across generations, because extreme phenotypes counter-selected. In natural populations, most traits are probably under stabilizing selection. Once a trait has reached an optimum in a population, selection will keep that trait at said optimum, removing variants that deviate from it.\n\n\n\n\n\nUnder stabilizing selection, intermediate individuals exhibit a fitness advantage, which does not change the population trait average (red triangle), but it causes a decrease in trait variation across generations (represented by the red bar).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n13.4.3 Disruptive Selection\nUnder disruptive selection, intermediate individuals have a fitness disadvantage over extreme phenotypes at either end of the spectrum. Hence, fitness functions under disruptive selection have a u-shaped curve (Figure @ref(fig:dissel)). Disruptive selection does not change the average trait value in a population, but it increases trait variation across generations and is an important mechanism for the maintenance of genetic variation. If disruptive selection persists for multiple generations, populations can exhibit bimodal trait distributions.\nDisruptive selection underlies many intraspecific polymorphisms where individuals of the same species are adapted to different habitats or resources. For example, the light and dark forms of the peppered moth that are well-camouflaged on either light or dark backgrounds, or the different beak morphs in seedcrackers that exploit different food resources, are a consequence of disruptive selection. In addition, disruptive selection can cause speciation; the stark beak size differences among species of Darwin’s finches are caused by disruptive selection.\n\n\n\n\n\nUnder disruptive selection, intermediate individuals have a fitness disadvantage. As a consequence, trait variation is increased across generations (red bars) but the mean trait value (red triangle) does not change.",

    "section": "13.5 Identifying Genes Underlying Quantitative Traits",
    "text": "13.5 Identifying Genes Underlying Quantitative Traits\nWhile basic quantitative genetic analyses can ignore the genes underlying adaptation, a key goal in evolutionary biology is to bridge the genotype-phenotype gap. We aim to identify adaptive genetic variation and link it to the expression of phenotypic traits. Hence, identifying the genetic basis of quantitative traits involved in adaptation is a key objective of many evolutionary studies. Detecting genes that contribute to the expression of quantitative traits can be challenging—especially when there are many genes that impact a particular trait, when the average effect of individual loci is small, and when sample sizes for quantitative analyses are low. Here, I will briefly introduce two general approaches that can be used to identify the genes associated with quantitative traits: quantitative trait locus (QTL) mapping and genome-wide association studies (GWAS).\n\n13.5.1 QTL Mapping\nQuantitative trait loci (QTLs) are stretches of DNA that are correlated with variation in a phenotypic trait. QTLs are linked to specific genes that contribute to variation in a particular phenotypic trait. They can be identified through QTL mapping, which hinges on genotyping and phenotyping large numbers of individuals derived from experimental crosses (also called a mapping population). To generate a mapping population for a trait of interest, two individuals from the opposite extremes of a phenotypic spectrum are chosen. Let’s assume we are studying a species of fish with populations living under different environmental conditions. The fish are blue in some habitats and orange in others, and we want to identify the genetic basis of this color variation. In this case, we would cross a blue and an orange individual to produce an F1 generation. Individuals in the F1 generation are phenotypically intermediate between the two parents, because they are heterozygous at loci relevant for the expression of the quantitative trait (Figure @ref(fig:qtl1)). To create a mapping population for QTL analysis, we need to produce at least an F2 cross by mating two F1 individuals with each other. Thanks to recombination, F2 individuals inherit a varying mixture of genetic material from either parental individual of the initial cross, and accordingly, some individuals will be entirely blue, some entirely orange, and others may exhibit any color mixture in between. With each generation of crossing (F3, F4, F5, etc.), genomic segments are reshuffled and the size of linkage blocks (contiguous stretches of DNA that come from one parental individual) gets smaller and smaller (Figure @ref(fig:qtl1)). We can then use this mapping population to ask which genomic regions are correlated with the phenotype of interest: at what loci do the genotypes match the observed phenotypic expression? To address this question, we need to quantify the phenotype of individuals in our mapping population, and we need to identify the genotypes of the same individuals at as many loci in the genome as feasible.\n\n\n\n\n\nGeneral approach for the creation of a mapping population for QTL analysis. Individuals from opposite ends of the phenotypic spectrum are crossed to obtain an F1 generation, which is then crossed with itself to produce F2 and later (Fx) crosses. Repeated crossing reshuffles genomic segments, which allows for the identification of correlations between genotype and phenotype. For example, the genomic region highlighted with the arrow shows a clear match between genotype and phenotype for each individual; i.e., this locus would be a QTL.\n\n\n\n\nGenotypic and phenotypic analyses create a data matrix where information for different individuals is organized in rows, and information about phenotypic traits and the genotype at particular loci is organized in columns (Figure @ref(fig:qtl2)). This allows us to directly compare the phenotypic traits of individuals with their genotypes across loci. As you can see in the example in Figure @ref(fig:qtl2), there is no congruence between phenotype and genotype at loci A, B, and C. However, there is a clear correlation between phenotype and the genotype at locus D: all blue individuals have the DD genotype, all orange individuals have the dd genotype, and all brown individuals are heterozygous. Hence, locus D would be a QTL for the color variation observed in our mapping population.\nIn practice, correlations between phenotypes and genotypes are evaluated for all loci in the dataset, and the degree of association between a phenotype and the genotype at a particular locus is quantified with an LOD score (LOD stands for logarithm of odds). The statistical details are not that important at this stage, but a higher LOD score indicates a stronger association between a particular locus and the phenotype of interest. An LOD score of 3 is equivalent to a p-value of 0.05; so we consider LOD scores greater than 3 as significant associations between a locus and a phenotype. Graphically, LOD scores are plotted as function of the location of the loci on a chromosome. You can imagine the chromosomes with their loci lined up along the x-axis, and LOD-score peaks above 3 are indicative of genomic regions containing a QTL (Figure @ref(fig:qtl2)).\n\n\n\n\n\nConceptual illustration of the results from a QTL experiment. The gray box shows the data structure, with information from different individuals organized in rows and phenotypic measurements and genotypes at different loci in columns. The graph above shows a qualitative representation of the correlations between genotype and phenotype in the matrix below.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n13.5.2 GWAS\nQTL mapping is a powerful approach for identifying genomic regions that are associated with quantitative traits. However, the approach also comes with obvious limitations: large-scale crossing experiments are not possible in many species for which we may want to investigate the genetic basis of adaptive trait variation. This is especially true if we want to better understand genotype-phenotype relationships in humans. Understanding the association between genetic variation and phenotypic traits in humans not only teaches us about our nature, but has profound implication for the prediction and treatment of infectious and noncommunicable diseases.\nGWAS (genome-wide association study) is an approach to identify loci underlying complex traits that does not hinge on the availability of crosses between contrasting phenotypes. Rather than looking for correlations between trait expression and the genotypes at specific loci, GWAS contrasts allele frequencies between different groups of individuals. Imagine, for example, that we want to identify genes associated with the susceptibility to a particular disease. In this case, we would compare allele frequencies in individuals that have contracted that disease (cases) with allele frequencies of a random sample of individuals from the general population (controls). For loci that do not impact disease susceptibility, we do not expect significant differences in allele frequencies between cases and controls; the likelihood that a case or a control has a particular allele is equal to the allele frequency in the population. However, if there is a significant difference in the allele frequencies at a particular locus, it indicates that genetic variation at that locus is potentially associated with becoming a case (i.e., contracting the disease). Like QTL mapping, GWAS requires extensive genotyping, both in terms of the number of loci in the genome and the number of individuals in the case and control groups. GWAS results are plotted similarly to QTL results, with the location of the genetic marker on the x-axis. Instead of LOD scores, GWAS plot the -log10 of the p-value associated with allele frequency differences at each locus, leading to peaks at loci showing significant associations with the trait of interest.",

    "text": "14.1 Social Behavior\nSocial interactions between members of the same species can take many forms, from agonistic interactions (when individuals compete for the same resources) to cooperation (where individuals work together during foraging, predator avoidance, or reproduction). From an evolutionary perspective, different social behaviors can be categorized in terms of the fitness costs and benefits that are associated with the donor and recipient. Natural selection can readily explain the evolution of behaviors that result in a benefit for the donor, both when the recipient also benefits (cooperation) and when the recipient incurs a cost (selfish behaviors). Individuals are selected to maximize their own fitness and not the fitness of the group. For example, cooperative hunting in wolves is adaptive because a pack can tackle larger prey species than a single individual. At the same time, alpha wolves excluding members of the pack from eating the most nutritious portions of a fresh kill is also adaptive, because alpha wolves can maximize their fitness when they retain the best resources for themselves and their offspring. Thus, natural selection prompts these magnificent predators to cooperate when they need to and act selfishly when they can.\nIn contrast, the evolution of social behaviors that harm the donor is more difficult to explain, because natural selection is predicted to eliminate alleles that make an individual incur fitness costs without any benefits. Behaviors that incur a cost to both the donor and the recipient are called “spiteful”; and as expected by theoretical considerations, spite is rare in nature (at least outside of high schools). However, altruistic behaviors—where the donor incurs a cost to benefit the recipient—are surprisingly common. For example, prairie dogs (Cynomys ludovicianus) will vocalize loud warning calls when potential predators approach a colony (see video below). The advance warning allows other members of the colony to seek shelter rapidly, but it also delays the escape response of the caller. The caller exposes itself to an increased risk to help other members of the colony. How do these types of altruistic behaviors evolve? Darwin himself recognized that the prevalence of altruism in the animal kingdom is a problem of “special difficulty, which at first appeared to me insuperable, and actually fatal to my own theory” (Darwin 1859). Here, we will consider two non-mutually exclusive explanations for altruism—kin selection and reciprocity—that were developed in the 1960s and 1970s.",

    "text": "14.1.1 Kin Selection\nThe English evolutionary biologist Bill Hamilton proposed that alleles for altruism can spread in a population if two things are true: (1) Altruistic behaviors primarily benefit closely related individuals, and (2) if the costs of an altruistic act to the donor is small compared to the benefit gained by the recipient. Specifically, Hamilton’s rule posits that altruism can evolve under the following condition:\n\\[\\begin{align}\nBr-C&gt;0 \\iff r&gt;\\frac{C}{B} (\\#eq:44)\n\\end{align}\\]\nIn this case, B is the benefit to the recipient, C is the cost to the donor, and r is the coefficient of relatedness between the two individuals. Note that r is double the coefficient of inbreeding (F), which was introduced in Chapter 6. So altruism, even among more distantly related individuals, can spread in a population as long as the cost to benefit ratio is smaller than r (Equation @ref(eq:43)).\nThe rationale behind this transformative idea was that if fitness is an individual’s contribution to the gene pool of the next generation, and if related individuals share some of the same genes, then the contribution of relatives to the gene pool of the next generation should also count toward an individual’s fitness. To formalize this idea, Hamilton broadened how we define fitness. According to his definition, the inclusive fitness of an individual is the sum of an individual’s personal reproduction (direct fitness) and the reproduction of relatives (indirect fitness). So an individual can increase its inclusive fitness by investing in its own reproduction and by aiding the reproduction of a relative, as long as the costs and benefits follow Hamilton’s rule. This form of natural selection, which favors costly traits that increase indirect fitness, is called kin selection.\nThe idea of kin selection makes a very simple, testable prediction: individuals should behave altruistically toward kin more often than toward unrelated individuals. Observational studies on prairie dogs’ propensity to vocalize warning calls during simulated predator attacks support this prediction. Both female and male prairie dogs are more likely to respond to predator attacks when kin are present (Figure @ref(fig:pdogs)A). In addition, the behavior of individual prairie dogs changes throughout their lives. Hogland (1983) followed several male prairie dogs as they lived in their birth colony (kin present), emigrated to a new colony upon reaching sexual maturity (kin absent), became reproductive in that new colony and sired their own offspring (kin present), and—in one rather sad case—were evicted from their breeding colony at old age (kin absent). As you can see in Figure @ref(fig:pdogs)B, even intra-individual variation in behavior is consistent with kin selection, as males behave more altruistically when kin is present, and they behave more selfishly when kin is absent.\n\n\n\n\n\nA. Percent of individual prairie dogs (Cynomys ludovicianus) responding with an alarm call to a simulated predator attack. Both males and females have a higher propensity to respond when related individuals are present. Data from Hogland (1983). B. Behavioral changes of male prairie dogs as they move from their birth colony (kin present), to a new colony (kin absent), where they eventually sire their own offspring (kin present), and are eventually evicted from (no kin present). Note data from different individuals is coded in different colors. Data from Hogland (1983).\n\n\n\n\nKin selection has changed our understanding of evolution beyond altruism. The conceptual framework established by Hamilton has also been applied to understand patterns of cannibalism (e.g., spadefoot toad tadpoles avoid eating siblings but will feast on other conspecifics), conflicts between parents and their offspring (e.g., mothers maximize their fitness by equally investing in all offspring, but offspring maximize their fitness by receiving more resources than their siblings), and the evolution eusociality with non-reproductive casts in hymenopterans, termites, and naked mole-rats.\n\nExplore More: Kin Selection and the Evolution of Eusociality\nIf you are interested in learning more about kin selection and the debates around social biology, check out the Quanta Magazine article “The Elusive Calculus of Insect Altruism” by Jordana Cepelewicz.\n\n\n\n14.1.2 Reciprocal Altruism\nTo explain the evolution of altruism between unrelated individuals, Bob Trivers proposed that individuals can be selected to help others if they can expect an equally valuable payback later on. This idea is known as reciprocal altruism. Two conditions need to be met for reciprocal altruism to spread in a population: (1) Similar to Hamilton’s ideas, the cost of an altruistic act to the donor must be smaller then the benefit to the recipient. (2) Individuals that do not reciprocate an altruistic act need to be punished. Accordingly, reciprocal altruism is expected to evolve especially in species with stable social groups that offer many opportunities for symmetrical altruistic acts and with good memory to keep track of both reliable and unreliable group members.\nEvidence for reciprocal altruism comes from a variety of mammal species, including lions and primates. For example, vervet monkeys (Chlorocebus pygerythrus) are more likely to respond to solicitations of help if they were previously groomed by the solicitor (Figure @ref(fig:vervet)). Most notably, previous grooming experience only impacts the decision-making between unrelated individuals. Responsiveness to solicitations from kin is equally high irrespective of grooming history, indicating that kin selection and reciprocal altruism both play a role.\n\n\n\n\n\nA. Juvenile vervet monkey (Chlorocebus pygerythrus). Photo: Charles J. Sharp, CC BY-SA 4.0. B. Grooming between unrelated individuals increases the probability that they will subsequently attend to each others’ solcitations for aid (as measured by vocalization responses). In contrast, grooming did not impact interactions between kin. Data from Seyfarth and Cheney (1984).\n\n\n\n\nThe idea of reciprocal altruism ushered in a new area in mathematical biology that sought to explain under what circumstances individuals might choose to cooperate with each other, or not. Game theory provides an analytical framework to quantify the merit of different behavioral strategies based on a payoff matrix that describes the outcomes of different interactions.\nTo explore this in more detail, let’s consider a classical game analyzed in game theory, called the prisoner’s dilemma. Imagine two crooks were picked up by the police and held in separate cells for interrogation, so they cannot communicate with each other. The cops don’t actually have enough evidence for a conviction for the murder the crooks are accused of, but they have plenty of evidence to convict them of some lesser crimes. So the cops offer each the prisoners a bargain: betray your friend and testify against them, or cooperate with them and stay silent. Of course there are four possible outcomes to the dilemma (Table 10.1): (1) Both prisoners cooperate with each other by staying silent, and as a consequence, both only have to serve the sentence for the minor crime (reward, R). (2) Prisoner 1 cooperates but prisoner 2 rats his friends out. In this case, prisoner 1 gets the sentence for murder with an extra hard sentence for lying (they get the sucker’s payoff, S), and prisoner 2 walks free for helping the police. (3) Prisoner 1 defects and prisoner 2 cooperates. In this case, prisoner 1 walks free for helping the police (they receive the temptation payoff, T), and prisoner 2 gets the harsh sentence for murder. (4) Both prisoners defect, and they both get punished for murder (punishment, P). In a classical prisoner’s dilemma game, the payoffs must fulfill the following conditions: \\[\\begin{align}\nT&gt;R&gt;P&gt;S (\\#eq:45) \\\\\nR&gt;\\frac{S+T}{2} (\\#eq:46)\n\\end{align}\\]\nSo what would you do if you were in this situation? From an evolutionary perspective, the optimal solution is clear if the game is only played once: you should defect! If you assume your opponent cooperated, defecting is a better option (you would walk free). If you assume your opponent is defecting, you should still defect because the punishment lower (P&gt;S). Simply put: behaving selfishly is the optimal strategy if you only have one chance to play this game.\nIf the game is played multiple times, however, the strategy with the highest payoff for each individual is called tit for tat (TFT). This strategy requires that an individual initially cooperates with any new opponent it encounters. In any subsequent interactions, individuals then respond in the same way their opponent did in the previous round. So if the opponent cooperated in the last interaction, the best strategy is to keep cooperating; if the opponent defected in the last interaction, the best strategy is to retaliate by defecting this time around, just to return back to cooperation during the next interaction. Note optimal strategies in these types of games change depending on the conditions set up in the the payoff matrix. For example, the optimal strategy under a more relaxed set of condition is tit for two tat, where players forgive two defections before retaliating and returning to cooperation.\nThe tit-for-tat strategy in the case of the classical prisoner’s dilemma (i.e., under the condition set forth by Equations @ref(eq:45)-@ref(eq:46)) is called an evolutionary stable strategy (ESS). When adopted by all individuals in the population, an ESS cannot be displaced by any alternative strategy, and any mutation that introduces a novel strategy will be selected against. ESS are essentially equivalent to Nash equilibria—the mathematical solution to non-cooperative games in game theory. This provides a powerful framework to study animal behavior in an evolutionary context, because we can use game theory to make theoretical predictions about the optimality of social behaviors and then test those predictions using experiments (similar to the use of the marginal value theorem in optimal foraging analyses discussed in Chapter 9).\n\nTable 10.1: Example of a payoff matrix for an interaction between two players.

    "section": "14.2 Sexual Selection",
    "text": "14.2 Sexual Selection\nSocial interactions between individuals of the same species frequently occur during reproduction. Among the most conspicuous phenomena evident during reproductive interactions are the disparities in appearance and behavior of males and females from the same species. Think of male elk fighting with their elaborate antlers, while females wander by to evaluate the different contenders. Or check out male birds of paradise with their flashy colors, elongated feathers, and bizarre dance moves… all to impress largely disinterested females.\n\n\n\n\nIf such sexual dimorphism in physical appearance and behavior is the consequence of adaptive evolution, selection clearly has to be acting differently on each sex. Darwin (1871) introduced the idea of sexual selection—like kin selection, a special form of natural selection—to describe how members of each sex can maximize their fitness in the context of different constraints imposed on each sex. In this section, we will first examine what sex-specific constraints cause sexual selection, and then explore the evolutionary consequences of sexual selection for interactions between members of the same sex and interactions between the sexes.\n\n14.2.1 Causes of Sexual Selection\nThe core cause for sex-specific selection is that males and females differ in their investment into the production of offspring. Angus John Bateman, an English geneticist, was the first to recognize that the production of sperm in males requires substantially less energetic investment than the production of eggs in females (hence, this is now known as Bateman’s principle). These asymmetries in energetic investment between the sexes hold true across a broad range of taxa (Figure @ref(fig:gamete)), and the magnitude of the differential investment is staggering: females invest about 300 % of energy used for basal metabolism into the production of egg biomass, while males only invest about 0.1 % into the production of sperm (Hayward and Gillooly 2011). That is, on average, a 3,000-fold difference in energetic investment just into the production of gametes. In many species, however, investment into offspring does not stop with the production of gametes; females often provide offspring with resources and protection during internal gestation and after birth. In mammals, for example, the energetic costs associated with gamete production is not all that different between the sexes, but female costs associated with maternal provisioning during pregnancy and milk production postpartum by far outweigh energetic investments by males of the same species. By an large, mothers tend to make much larger energy and time investments into the production of offspring than fathers do.\n\n\n\n\n\nRelationship between body mass and daily production rates of sperm and egss across different groups of organisms. Based on production rates, the energetic cost of egg production is about 3 orders of magnitude higer than the cost of sperm production. In other words, females invest about 300% of energy used for basal metabolism into the production of egg biomass, while males only invest about 0.1% of energy used for basal metabolism into the production of sperm biomass. Data from Hayward and Gillooly (2011).\n\n\n\n\nThe asymmetries in parental investment between the sexes set different constraints on the maximum reproductive output for males and females. The maximum reproductive output of females is primarily constrained by time and energy. There are only so many eggs one female can produce, or only so many times a female can be pregnant during her lifetime. In contrast, the reproductive success of males is primarily constrained by the number of mating partners. As a consequence, males can increase their lifetime reproductive success much more dramatically when they mate with multiple females than females can when they mate with multiple males (Figure @ref(fig:salamander)). The slope of the regression line between the number of mates and the number of offspring is a direct measure of the strength of sexual selection on that sex (these regression lines are also known as Bateman gradients or sexual-selection gradients). The slope of these sexual-selection gradients and the differences in the slopes between the sexes can vary dramatically among species. For example, in species where a significant investment of both the mother and the father is required (think of the many songbirds with biparental care), the sexual-selection gradients may be relatively flat and not significantly different between the sexes. In such cases, sexual selection is relatively weak. In contrast, sexual selection is particularly strong in lekking-species, where males provide nothing to the production of offspring besides the sperm needed for the fertilization of eggs, and females are left to produce and take care of the offspring.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe number of offspring produced as a function of mating success for male and female rough-skinned newts (Taricha granulosa). The rate at which males can increase their reproductive success through multiple mating exceeds that of females. Note that the slope of the best-fit lines are also known as sexual-selection gradients. Data from Jones et al. (2002).\n\n\n\n\nAn inadvertent consequence of the asymmetries in parental investment between the sexes is that variation in reproductive success is much more pronounced in males than in females. Typically, most females that survive to adulthood will have at least some reproductive success, and differences in reproductive success among females are relatively small. For example, lifetime reproductive success in female elephant seals (Mirounga angustirostris) that reach adulthood ranges between 1 and 10 (Figure @ref(fig:seaele)). In contrast, variation in reproductive success in males is much more pronounced, because males compete intensely for access to females. Some males end up winning in these competitive interactions and sire a disproportionate amount of offspring in a population, denying that opportunity to many other males that were defeated. Thus, most male northern elephant seals have zero reproductive success even if they reach sexual maturity, and a small number of dominant males can produce up to 100 offspring each during their lifetime (Figure @ref(fig:seaele)).\n\n\n\n\n\nVariation in lifetime reproductive success for female and male northern elephant seals (Mirounga angustirostris). Most individuals of both sexes never reproduce successfully. But while successful females can maximally produce 10 offspring during their lifetime, some male sea elephants that successfully monomolize females in a harem can sire up 100 offspring. Data from Le Boeuf and Reiter (1988).\n\n\n\n\nAsymmetries in reproductive success are also evident in humans. The record for most children born goes to Mrs. Feodor Vassilyev in 19th century Russia, who reportedly had 69 children carried over 27 pregnancies. In contrast, the record for most children sired is held by Moulay Ismail, an emperor of the Moroccan Alaouite dynasty that fathered at least 1,171 children from 1672 - 1727. While these are obviously extreme outliers, a similar reproductive skew is observable when we analyze reproductive rates in women and men across different countries (Figure @ref(fig:hooman)). Especially in countries where women bear more than four children on average, there is clear evidence for a skew in reproductive output between men and women, as indicated by the fact that many points lie above the 1:1 line that indicated equal reproductive output.\n\n\n\n\n\nVariation in male and female fertility across ~80 different countries. Data from United Nations (2015).\n\n\n\n\nUltimately, the evolutionary consequence of reproductive asymmetries between the sexes is that natural selection favors different strategies in males and females to maximize reproductive success. Males, whose reproductive success is primarily constrained by the number of mates, should face intense competition among each other and evolve traits that allow them to exclude competitors and monopolize females. In turn, females, being constrained by time and and energy, should be fiercely protective of their heavy investment and carefully choose potential mates in a way that maximizes their own and their offspring’s fitness.\n\n\n14.2.2 Intrasexual Selection: Male-Male Competition\nCompetition between males for access to females is also known as intrasexual selection. Intrasexual selection favors traits that increase male’s ability to fertilize as many eggs as possible, either by overt combat with other males or more covert strategies. In addition, intrasexual selection can lead to sexual conflict, because strategies that maximize the reproductive success of one sex (typically the males) may be detrimental to the reproductive success of the other sex (typically the females).\n\nOvert Combat\nIntense competition between males for access to females should favor traits that allow males to exert dominance over competitors and exclude them from copulating with females in the population. Hence, male-male competition tends to lead to the evolution of increased male body size (leading to sexual size dimorphism), weapons and defensive structures, and tactical cleverness (Figure @ref(fig:sexdim)). The development of such traits can come at considerable costs for males. In many species with strong intrasexual selection, males have a delayed onset of sexual maturity, and even sexually mature males may not be competitive for multiple breeding seasons. For example, male lions often live solitarily or in small bachelor prides for several years until they are strong and experienced enough to challenge a resident alpha male. In addition, males are often unable to sustain reproductive activities for prolonged periods of time, and the maintenance of alpha status is associated with loss of body condition and increased mortality. So while female elk reach peak reproductive capacity by age four and are able to maintain that productivity for up to a decade, male elk do not reach peak reproductive capacity until age eight or nine and can only maintain it for a few reproductive seasons (Figure @ref(fig:elk)).\n\n\n\n\n\nExamples of evolutionary outcomes in response to strong intrasexual selection: antlers in moose (Alces alces) used for fighting; the lion’s (Panthera leo) mane provides protection during fights with competitors; sexual size dimoprhism in elephant seals (Mirounga angustirostris) and American bison (Bison bison). All photos are CC0.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA. Sex-dependent survivial in elk (Cervus canadensis). Male survival declines rapidly after the onset of peak reproductive productivity. B. Average reproductiove output for male and female elk. Females start producing calves earlier in life and longer than males. Males do not start reproducing succeffully until later in life, and their reproductive output declines fast after they reach their peak. Data from Del Castillo et al. (1999).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCovert Combat\nCompetition among males for access to females does not always lead to overt combat with physical altercation; competition can also play out in more subtle ways, especially when males cannot prevent females from copulating with other males. In many species, individual females may be mating with multiple males during a reproductive cycle, and competition between males still occurs after insemination. Specifically, sperm of different males are competing for the fertilization of a female’s eggs. In species with intense sperm competition, selection can favor males that produce larger ejaculates with more sperm, as evidenced—for example—by the correlation between testis size and the degree of promiscuity in apes. If you are wondering… humans are right in between gorillas (smaller testicles because the dominance of a single male reduces sperm competition) and chimpanzees (larger testicles due to intense sperm competition associated with frequent multiple mating).\nAdaptive responses to sperm competition are also associated with changes in sperm quality. For example, selection can act on sperm mobility (swimming speed) and sperm longevity, providing males with an advantage when their sperm compete with others for fertilization. In many species with internal fertilization, males have also evolved other strategies that prevent other males from successfully inseminating females or fertilizing their eggs. Males of some species prevent other males from copulating with females by mate guarding (e.g., the amplexus seen in many anurans), prolonged periods of copulation (e.g., the post-copulatory tie in dogs when the male’s penis swells inside of the females vagina, physically tying both partners together), or in the form of copulation plugs, where males deposit proteins along with their ejaculate that literally seal up females’ genital tract and prevent successful copulation by other males (e.g., in some primates, rodents, and many arthropods). Males of some species have modified copulatory organs that not only allow for the deposition of sperm into females’ genital tracts, but that can also remove sperm deposited by other males (this is called sperm displacement). Sperm displacement adaptations are well documented in arthropods (Figure @ref(fig:damsel)) and surprisingly well-studied in humans as well. Another strategy is the release of toxic substances in ejaculates that can impede the success of competing sperm or the propensity of females to mate with other partners. This strategy is well studied in insects, where toxins are produced in accessory glands associated with the male gonads; hence, these toxins are known as accessory gland proteins (AGPs).\n\n\n\n\n\nA.

Sperm volumes found in female damselflies before copulation, at the end of stage I, and after the copulation. The decline in volume at the end of stage I indicates that males remove sperm from previous partners to replace it with theor own. Data from Cordero-Rivera (2016).\n\n\n\n\nCovert combat, however, is not restricted to sperm competition. Whenever intense competition opens an evolutionary arms race toward ever greater physical prowess, it also opens up space for alternative mating strategies. Some males just work smarter and not harder. Alternative mating strategies are common in many insects and fishes, and typically associated with smaller males—so called “sneakers”—that sneak copulations with females. In bluegill sunfish (Lepomis machrochirus), for example, parental males grow large, defend territories, and woo females using courtship displays. Parental males also provide brood care after spawning, thus heavily investing in reproduction. In contrast, sneaker males mature at a much smaller size (Figure @ref(fig:sufisneakers)) and mimic females in coloration and even pheromone profile. The small males dart into the nest of parental males during the spawning act and release their own sperm, inadvertently fertilizing some of the eggs that are laid by the females and without participating in brood care later on. Sneaker males are exquisitely adapted to this alternative mating strategy. They are essentially swimming testes, as up to 25% of a sneaker male’s body mass is invested into its gonads (Figure @ref(fig:sufisneakers)). As a consequence, sneaker males produce much more sperm than parentals, although there is a trade-off with sperm longevity (Figure @ref(fig:sufisneakers)).\nAlternative mating strategies are maintained within populations by negative frequency-dependent selection. When sneaker males are rare, they have an advantage because parental males do not pay attention to them. As they become more common, however, parental males grow more vigilant and limit the success of sneakers by chasing them away, thus reducing their frequency in the population.\n\n\n\n\n\nBluegill sunfish (Lepomis machrochirus) have males with different mating strategies. Parental males grow large and defend territories with developing young, while sneaker males are much smaller and steal fertilizations from parental without providing any care. The alternative reproductive strategies are reflected in differential investments into gonad development (gonadosomal index, GSI) as well as sperm traits (number and longevity). Data from Neff et al. (2003).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n14.2.3 Sexual Conflict\nMale adaptations to intrasexual selection can impose significant costs on females, leading to sexual conflict. Sexual conflict occurs whenever the two sexes embark on conflicting reproductive strategies to maximize their fitness. For example, males might maximize their reproductive output by maximizing the number of copulations they conduct, but females might maximize their fitness by minimizing the number of copulations after their eggs are fertilized. After all, extraneous copulations can come with a potential loss of foraging opportunities, physical harm, and sexually transmitted diseases.\nHowever, females are not passive bystanders in these mating games. In some species, females have evolved structural adaptations to minimize the negative impacts of unwanted copulations, or to make copulations without cooperation difficult, if not impossible. In others, females are able to produce enzymes that break down copulation plugs or neutralize the damaging effects of AGPs. Many species can also store sperm, which allows females to minimize interactions with males all together.\nSo while intrasexual selection drives males to evolve traits that mediate ever higher persistence, females evolve traits that mediate resistance to unwanted male advances; there is a continuous cycle of adaptation and counteradaptation—an antagonistic coevolutionary arms race between persistence and resistance traits (just like the arms race between hosts and pathogens). This notion contrasts starkly with the romantic “the birds and the bees” perspective of reproductive biology. Yes, both sexes are required for successful reproduction (in most species at least), and there is a certain degree of shared interest and cooperation between males and females, especially in species where males also participate in parental care. But in many species, the reproductive interactions between the sexes are marred by conflicting interests, and traits that mediate high male persistence can cause significant reductions of female fitness. An extreme example is a form of mating called traumatic insemination (found in beg bugs and other insects), where males use hypodermic genitalia to pierce through the females’ body wall during copulation. Males completely bypass females’ choice and genital tract and ejaculate directly into the blood system, from where eggs are fertilized. Females subject to traumatic insemination can face significant costs associated with wound healing and infection, reducing their overall reproductive success.\nThe evolutionary impacts of sexual conflict are illustrated by the coevolution of male and female genitalia in waterfowl with different mating systems. While most birds lack external genitalia, male waterfowl have evolved a phallus. The length and morphological complexity of the phallus varies among species and is dependent on the frequency of forced extra-pair copulations. Species in which such copulations are rare have small (~1.5 cm), simple phalli; those with a high frequency of forced extra-pair compilations have longer phalli (up to 40 cm) that are covered with spines and groves (see Figure @ref(fig:duckpenis)A-D). Hence, larger and more complex phalli provide males with an advantage when trying to copulate with uncooperative females. Female waterfowl, however, also exhibit exceptional variation in their genitalia, including dead-end sacs (pouches) and clockwise coils associated with their vaginae. Comparative analyses have indicated that the complexity of vaginal morphology is directly correlated with phallus length (Figure @ref(fig:duckpenis)E), suggesting that vaginal complexity has evolved as a counteradaptation that limits the success of unwanted copulations. Consequently, the elaboration of traits that increase male persistence may not be just a consequence of intense competition between males, but also conflicting interests between the sexes.\n\n\n\n\n\nExamples of genital covariation in waterfowl.

(E) Relationship between male phallus length and the number of pouches and spirals in the female vagina across different species of waterfowl. Pictures and data from Brennan et al. (2007).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n14.2.4 Intersexual Selection: Female Mate Choice\nIn many species where males’ ability to monopolize females is limited, they instead compete for mates through courtship. In such cases, females choose with whom they mate; such selection via female choice is known as intersexual selection. Females have been documented making mate choices based on a wide variety of behavioral, structural, color, and chemical traits (Figure @ref(fig:manakin)). In this section, we will explore why females evolve preferences for particular male traits and how those preferences in turn affect the evolution of male ornaments.\n\n\n\n\n\nA.Male golden-collared manakin (Manacus vitellinus). Photo by Aaron Maizlish, CC BY-NC 2.0. B. Female manakins make mating decisions based on the coloration of males, and plumage brightness predicts male mating success in this species. Data from Stein and Uy (2005).\n\n\n\n\n\nChooser Biases\nFemales may not specifically evolve a preference for a particular male trait; rather, they may just have one. Of course, females’ sensory systems are primarily shaped by natural selection, not sexual selection. Each species’ senses are fine-tuned to filter out relevant information from background noise for orientation, foraging, predator avoidance, and social interactions. Male sexual signals may simply evolve to match the sensory perceptions that females have already evolved in another context. For example, imagine a bird species that is specialized to forage on red fruit, and thus has evolved a visual system attuned to detecting red against a background of green leaves. A male that exhibits a mutation for red feathers may become more attractive to females because of their pre-existing adaptations for detecting red. In such a case, males are said to exploit pre-existing sensory biases by tuning their sexual signals to match the sensitivity of females’ sensory systems.\nSensory adaptations associated with foraging have been associated with female preferences in a variety of taxa, and the hypothetical example with the red color is grounded in actual examples from fish. Both guppies (Poecilia reticulata) and stickleback (Gasterosteus aculeatus) exhibit mating preferences for red and orange male ornaments and show similar biases for red and orange food items during foraging. Similarly, male water mites (Neumania papillator) mimick the vibration of drowning prey items to attract potential female partners. Finally, males of the swordtail characin (Corynopoma riisei) exhibit structural ornaments attached to their gill covers that mimic the shape of the terrestrial invertebrates this species feeds on, as evidenced by the correlation between diet composition (proportion of ants) and the shape similarity between ants and the ornament (Figure @ref(fig:corynopoma)A). In addition, the strength of female response to ant-like ornaments changes plastically when females are fed ants as opposed to non-ant prey items (Figure @ref(fig:corynopoma)B). This observation suggests that even short-term changes in female sensory processing (e.g., through habituation and learning) can change how they respond to sexual signals presented by males.\n\n\n\n\n\nA. The shape of male ornaments in the swordtail characin (Corynopoma riisei) is more similar to ants in populations where ants make up a higher proportion of the diet. B. Recent dietary experience changes female responses to male ornaments. Ant-fed females direct more bites at ant-like orgnaments than females fed on Drosophila larvae (experiment 1) or flake food (experiment 2). Data on ornament morphology and female behavior from Kolm et al. (2012).\n\n\n\n\nWhile correlations between female preferences in sexual and non-sexual contexts provide evidence for pre-existing sensory biases, a key prediction of sensory bias models for sexual trait evolution is that female preferences evolve prior to the the corresponding male ornaments, and not vice versa. Hence, comparative analyses that explore both the evolution of female preferences and male ornaments are requisite for identifying evidence for sensory biases. Comparative evidence for sensory biases comes from livebearing fishes of the family Poeciliidae. Males in one group of poeciliids, the swordtails of the genus Xiphophorus, exhibit a conspicuous extension of the caudal fin (the eponymous sword), and males with longer swords are preferred by females. However, the preference for the sword is not just present in swordtails, but also in females of swordless species in the same genus (the platyfishes) and even females of species in other genera (Figure @ref(fig:sensorybias)). Hence, the female preference evolved well before the male ornament, and it eventually potentiated the evolution of a novel trait when a random mutation causing the development of the sword arose.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe evolution of female preferences for a sword-like appendage in the caudal fin of some Poeciliid fishes predates the evolution for the actual male traits (adopted from Basolo 2002). Pictures on the left size show Priapella, Poecilia, Xiphophorus maculatus, and two species of swordtails (X. hellerii and X. montezumae).\n\n\n\n\nIt is important to note that sensory bias models of female preference evolution indicate that female preferences are non-adaptive with respect to the consequences of mate choice, at least initially. Females may gain fitness benefits by having certain sensory modalities in non-sexual context, but mating biases resulting from those sensory modalities is not expected to provide fitness benefits to the female or her offspring. In this regard, sensory bias models of preference evolution are different from other hypotheses discussed below.\n\n\nDirect Selection on Female Preferences\nFemale preference for particular male traits may evolve because choosy females increase their own survival or reproductive success compared to females that mate indiscriminately. Mutations for such adaptive preferences are expected to spread rapidly in a population, and direct fitness benefits are likely a leading cause for the evolution of mating preferences.\nDirect benefits are particularly important for females when males contribute resources to reproduction beyond sperm, including protection, access to territories with food resources or nesting sites, or help with parental care. In these cases, females that carefully choose males with adequate resources may be able to raise more offspring, thus increasing their lifetime reproductive success. Similarly, females that discriminate against males in poor physical condition or with signs of parasite infections are able to reduce their risk of contracting communicable diseases, potentially avoiding costs associated with immune responses or premature death.\nA classic example of direct benefits are nuptial gifts that males present to females either prior to or during copulation. Such nuptial gifts and courtship feeding can be observed in birds, mollusks, and many insects. For example, male hanging flies (Bittacus apicalis) provide females with an insect prey during courtship, and females preferentially mate with males providing larger nuptial prey items. If males provide small prey items, females interrupt the copulation prematurely (Figure @ref(fig:hanging)A), and such interruptions cut the male sperm transfer short (Figure @ref(fig:hanging)B).\n\n\n\n\n\nA. The copulation duration of hanging flies (Bittacus apicalis) depends on the size of the nuptial prey item a male presents to the female prior to copulation Data from Thornhill (1976). B. Copulation duration is correlated with the number of sperm a male can transfer. Hence, small nuptial prey items may result in incomplete fertilization. Data from Thornhill (1976).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIndirect Selection on Female Preferences\nWhile direct benefits certainly explain the evolution of female preferences in many contexts, why do females prefer elaborate male ornaments and courtship displays in species where they receive little more than sperm for the fertilization of their eggs? This is all the more puzzling because exaggerated male traits are particularly common in lekking species. A lek is an aggregation of males during courtship, where they competitively display and showcase their ornaments. Females visit the lek to inspect different competitors, choose to mate with one or a few of the males, and then leave to incubate the eggs and take care of the offspring by themselves. Besides sperm, there is zero contribution of males to reproduction, and the actual interaction between males and females (i.e., the copulation) can be over in a matter of seconds. So why do the females care? Consider the greater sage grouse (Centrocercus urophasianus) in the video below: why should females pay attention to those goofy air sacs, the fancy plumage, and the random dance moves advertised by males?\n\n\n\n\n\nGood Genes\nWhile females may not be getting direct fitness benefits by expressing a preference for a particular male trait, they can receive indirect fitness benefits if a particular choice benefits the survivability or reproductive success of their offspring. In other words, the exaggerated male ornaments and behaviors may be a reflection of the genetic quality of a male, potentially indicating high foraging success, metabolic efficiency, or resistance against parasites and diseases. The evolution of female mating preferences driven by such indirect fitness benefits is also known as the good genes hypothesis.\nThe good genes hypothesis makes two important predictions: (1) Ornaments should be reliable signals of individual quality. Hence, ornaments should be costly, such that males of inferior quality cannot cheat. (2) Females that mate with preferred mates should have offspring with higher survivorship or reproductive capacity compared to females that do not exert a choice. Empirical tests of both predictions in natural systems have provided robust evidence for the role of indirect fitness benefits in the evolution of female preferences and male traits in some species.\nEvidence for the condition-dependent expression of male ornaments comes from red-collard widowbirds (Euplectes ardens; Figure @ref(fig:widow)A). Males of this species exhibit elongated tail feathers, and tail feather variation among males is positively correlated with body condition, suggesting that males in better condition can grow larger tail feathers (Figure @ref(fig:widow)B). To experimentally test the effects of tail feather variation on male mating success and energetics, Sarah Pryke and Staffan Andersson captured widowbird males in their natural habitats and subjected them to one of two treatments: males either had their tail feathers clipped, or they were left untouched. Consistent with the prediction that tail feather length in an indicator of good male quality, unclipped males had much higher mating success than males with the shortened feathers (Figure @ref(fig:widow)C). Because tail length was manipulated experimentally and did not reflect variation in male condition, variation in mating success must have been primarily a consequence of female mate choice. Furthermore, following individual males throughout the reproductive season revealed that males with unclipped feathers lost body condition more rapidly than males with shortened tails (Figure @ref(fig:widow)D), indicating that living with the longer tail feathers is indeed costly, as predicted by the good genes hypothesis.\n\n\n\n\n\nA. Male red-collared widowbird (Euplectes ardens). Photo: Francesco Veronesi, CC BY-SA 2.0. B. Male tail length is correlated with body condition. Data from Pryke and Andersson (2005). C. Males that had their tails cut short had a lower number of active nests during the breeding season compared to males whose tails were not manipulated. Data from Pryke and Andersson (2005). D. Males whose tails were cut short lost less body condition over the course of the breeding season than un-manipulated males. This indicates that the long tail actually comes at a cost. Data from Pryke and Andersson (2005).\n\n\n\n\nEvidence for the second prediction of the good genes hypothesis comes from field observations of pronghorn antelope (Antilocapra americana). John Byers and Lisette Waits followed the survival of fawns that were either sired by attractive or unattractive males and found significant differences in offspring performance. Offspring of attractive males had a higher likelihood of surviving to weaning, and survivability for these offspring remained significantly elevated throughout most of their lives (Figure @ref(fig:pronghorn)A). Exercising a choice during mating consequently provides females with indirect fitness benefits in terms of offspring survival. Interestingly, direct benefits may also contribute to the evolution of female choice in this case, because females actually pay additional costs for mating with unattractive males. Females compensate for the subpar performance of offspring from unattractive males by increasing milk delivery to their young, which requires additional energy that other females can invest into maintenance or the future production of additional offspring.\n\n\n\n\n\nEvidence supporting the good genes hypothesis in pronghorn antelope (Antilocapra americana): A. Cummulative survival of offspring sired by attractive vs. unattractive males. Offspring of attractive males were more likely to survive to weaning and to age classes as late as 5 years. Data from Byers and Waits (2006). B. Matings with unattractive males also came with additional direct costs for females, as they compensated subpar offspring performance by elevating rates of milk delivery to their young. Data from Byers and Waits (2006).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRun-Away Selection\nIndirect selection on female mating preferences may also occur when there is a genetic correlation between the expression of a male ornament and a corresponding female preference. Such genetic correlations can cause self-perpetuating evolutionary loops, where a trait becomes more exaggerated because the preference becomes stronger, and vice versa. As a consequence, both male ornaments and female preference can evolve rapidly (hence the term run-away selection). Trait and preference evolution are only bound by natural selection; i.e., at some point the exaggeration of a trait starts to impact other organismal functions, and even though extreme trait and preference values may be favored by sexual selection, viability selection brings the process to a halt. Experimental evidence in variety of species have documented genetic correlations between female preferences and associated male traits that are required for runaway selection models. For example, investigating female preferences for red and the intensity of male abdominal coloration in stickleback fish has revealed significant correlations among experimental families (Figure @ref(fig:runaway)).\nRunaway selection scenarios can also arise through alternative mechanisms. For example, the sexy-son hypothesis posits that females gain indirect benefits from mating with attractive males, because they will also have attractive sons. In this case, evolution of female preferences and the corresponding male ornaments is also subject to a positive feedback loop that is eventually bound by natural selection.\n\n\n\n\n\nCorrelation between the expression of a male ornament (red coloration) and the corresponding female preference in crosses of stickleback.

    "text": "15.1.1 Interspecific Comparisons\nConvergent evolution—where evolutionarily-independent lineages evolve similar traits to adapt to similar ecological niches—is frequently invoked as evidence for adaptation. For example, the convergent modification of forelimbs to form wings in bats, birds, and pterosaurs all evolved as an adaptation to flying. The inference of convergence is not always so trivial, though—especially when focal species are more closely related, and the evolutionary independence of species is not necessarily evident.\nConsider Figure @ref(fig:phylpseurepl) as an example. In both scenarios (A and B), three species are associated with a novel habitat (habitat 2, in green) and exhibit divergence in a phenotypic trait. In the first scenario (Figure @ref(fig:phylpseurepl)A), the species in the novel habitat form a monophyletic group, suggesting that all three of them have inherited the novel habitat affiliation and the phenotypic trait modification from their shared ancestor. In other words, there has been a single evolutionary transition in habitat affiliation, and a single evolutionary transition in the phenotypic trait, which deflates the evidence for correlated evolution between habitat and trait as a consequence of adaptive evolution. After all, that same correlation may be spurious, having arisen by chance. This scenario is known as phylogenetic pseudoreplication; if we treat each species as an independent replicate, we gloss over the fact that there has only been a single evolutionary transition.\nIn the second scenario, the situation is different; the colonization of the novel environment and the associated change in phenotypic trait have independently occurred three times, as evidenced by the fact that all three species in habitat 2 (green) have a sister species in habitat 1 (blue; Figure @ref(fig:phylpseurepl)B). The fact that the same correlated changes happened independently multiple times provides more robust evidence for the effects of selection, as we would not expect the same habitat-trait association to evolve repeatedly by chance. As any good experiment designed by researchers, the quality of natural experiments also relies on adequate replication; it is the number of independent evolutionary shifts, and not the number of species, that is the unit of replication.\n\n\n\n\n\nTwo hypothetical scenarios of how the same pattern of association between habitat type and phenotype might arise. A. In the first scenario, habitat 2 (green) was invaded once by the shared ancestor of species 6, 7, and 8, representing a single evolutionary transition. This is an example of phylogenetic pseudoreplication. B. In the second scenario, species 1, 4, and 6 have independently colonized habitat 2 (green). Each of the species is sister to a species occuring in the ancestral habitat 1 (blue).\n\n\n\n\nIn reality, the phylogenetic distribution of traits does not neatly follow either scenario outlined in Figure @ref(fig:phylpseurepl). Consider the evolution of piscivory, and the associated evolutionary change in gape width, in the fish family Centrarchidae—which includes black basses, sunfishes, and crappies (Figure @ref(fig:sunfishes)). Naively, we could just compare the gape width of piscivorous and non-piscivorous species. But as you can glean from the from the phylogeny, the evolution of piscivory is more complicated. There are two independent transitions towards piscivory in the genus Lepomis, but multiple piscivorous species are derived from a single piscivorous ancestor in other clades (Micropterus and the clade with Ambloplites, Archolites, and Pomoxis).\nMulti-species comparative analyses consequently must account for the fact that species are related to each other to varying degrees. Comparing species of Lepomis is not the same as comparing species of Lepomis and Micropterus. More closely related species tend to be more similar than more distantly related ones, and comparative analyses need to account for that. In practice, we use phylogenetic comparative analyses (PCA) that explicitly include information about evolutionary relationships to test hypotheses about trait evolution. The use of well-resolved phylogenies in PCA allows us to statistically account for potential phylogenetic pseudoreplication in comparative analyses. Among the most commonly used methods in PCA are phylogenetically independent contrasts and phylogenetic generalized least squares, which are used to test associations among response variables while controlling for the non-independence of species.\n\n\n\n\n\nGape width variation of centrarchid fishes as a function of their dietary habits.

Single species studies either use observational approaches, examining organisms in their natural environment, or experimental approaches that manipulate a single, well-defined factor while other variables are held constant. Observational studies promote a better understanding of organisms in their natural environment, but they often cannot control for all confounding variables. Hence, observational studies are typically correlational and do not establish causation between traits, function, and fitness. In contrast, experimental manipulations allow us to establish causal relationship between variables, but sometimes lack the nuanced context of natural situations. There may be a causal link between variation in a trait and fitness under experimental conditions, but the results can be misleading if the experimental conditions are not representative of the natural context. The most powerful studies of adaptation consequently combine observational and experimental data. Here, I provide some illustrative examples of observational and experimental studies that focus on understanding the adaptive nature of animal behavior.\n\nObservation\nHabitat use is one of the most fundamental aspects of animal behavior. In ectotherms, habitat use is governed by a number of potential factors, including resource availability, predation risk, and a need for thermoregulation. But with competing needs, which factors determine where an individual chooses to spend its time? Huey and Kingsolver (1989) used thermal performance data of desert iguanas (Dipsosaurus dorsalis) to make predictions about habitat use in nature. Assessment of multiple aspects of temperature-dependent physiological performance (burst speed, digestive efficiency, endurance, and hearing efficiency; Figure @ref(fig:thermreg)A) indicated that the lizards’ optimal body temperature is between 35.4 and 40.6 °C (average: 38.7 °C). Above or below that range, physiological performance starts to decline. Huey and Kingsolver wanted to know if lizards in natural habitats choose their environment so as to optimize their physiological performance. Monitoring body temperature in free-ranging lizards indeed indicated that individuals choose their microhabitats to maintain a relatively narrow temperature range that coincides with the physiological performance optima. This adaptive behavior is called behavioral thermoregulation. The fact that lizard habitat choice is primarily driven by behavioral thermoregulation suggests that other factors—such as resource availability and predation—are not likely to limit the lizards’ ability to find microhabitats with suitable temperatures (or perhaps considering resource distribution and the presence of predators could explain why some lizards exhibited slightly higher or lower body temperatures than expected).\n\n\n\n\n\nA. Thermal performance curves for different performance metrics of desert iguanas. B. Frequency distribution of body temperatures of active lizards in nature. In both panels, the zone of optimal performance is indicated by gray shading, the average optimum by the red vertical line. Physiological performance and body temperature data from Huey & Kingsolver (1989).\n\n\n\n\nIn some instances, optimization of one behavior may be prevented by other competing needs. This is illustrated by the interaction between predator avoidance and foraging behaviors in stickleback fish (Gasterosteus aculeatus). In the absence of predators, stickleback preferentially feed at higher prey densities to maximize energy acquisition rates (Figure @ref(fig:stiba)). In contrast, when a predator (a kingfisher) is present, stickleback preferentially feed at lower densities. This shift in behavior reflects the competing sensory and cognitive resources required to navigate feeding while also paying attention to potential threats from predators. The results also highlight how observational studies can lead to conflicting results when the effects of confounding variables are not properly accounted for. Good observational studies quantify a wide variety of auxiliary data that allows researchers to exclude alternative hypotheses post hoc. Despite all the limitations, collecting observational data is often the only way to address evolutionary hypotheses in natural systems, simply because experimentation with elephants, colonies of army ants, or rainforest giants is just not feasible.\n\n\n\n\n\nPreferences of stickleback fish for diffferent prey densities in presence and absence of a predator (kingfisher). Data from Milinski & Heller (1978).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExperimentation\nExperimentation is among the most powerful tools in science, because the meticulous manipulation of specific variables—while holding all others constant—allows for the inference of causal relationships. Experimentation is particularly strong when motivated by solid observational data, which grounds experiments in biological realities, or by theoretical considerations. For example, theoretical considerations shaped the development of testable hypotheses and experiments in studies of optimal foraging. Optimal foraging theory investigates whether organisms behave in a manner that maximizes energy acquisition rates or efficiency, and it is grounded in a simple yet powerful mathematical framework.\nTo explore this in more detail, let’s imagine an organism—a bird for example—that forages in discrete habitat patches. An individual needs to travel to a particular patch and then start searching for prey items. As prey items are consumed, the rate at which they are encountered declines; hence, the the cumulative number of prey items found in a particular habitat patch is a decelerating curve, and the slope of the curve eventually approximates zero when all prey items in a patch are consumed (this is known as the law of diminishing returns). The big question is, at what point should the bird stop looking for prey items and instead travel to the next habitat patch where food is still abundant? It turns out that the optimal search time depends on the travel time between habitat patches and the shape of the curve describing the prey acquisition rate. The actual solution of the problem is most easily derived graphically, where the maximum rate of energy gain is defined by the slope of the tangent line of the prey acquisition curve that goes through the point defining the travel time on the x-axis (Figure @ref(fig:optfor1)A). If the individual spends less than the optimal feeding time in a patch, the slope of the line declines, reducing the energy gain per unit time. If the individual spends more than the optimal feeding time in a patch, the the slope of the line, and consequently the rate of energy gain, declines as well.\nThis basic model of optimal foraging allows us to make very clear theoretical predictions about how variation in travel time should affect the optimal amount of time spent in any given foraging patch. If the travel time between patches is relatively short, individuals should spend less time in a particular foraging patch (Figure @ref(fig:optfor1)B). In contrast, if travel times between patches are longer, the energy acquisition rate is maximized when search times are longer as well. But do organisms actually behave optimally? Has natural selection led to organisms making economical decisions?\n\n\n\n\n\nThe marginal value theorem applied to optimal foraging. A. For any travel time (plotted in blue along the negative portion of the x-axis), the maximum rate of energy acquisition can be determined as the slope of the tangent line of the prey acquisition curve that goes through the point defining the travel time on the x-axis. Accordingly, the optimal search time and the optimal prey number are given by the x and y coordinates of the tangent point. B. Varyint the travel time from shory (brown) to long (pink) changes the optimal food searching time from short to long.\n\n\n\n\nThe optimal foraging model makes clear predictions that can be tested experimentally. To do so, Kacelnik (1984) trained free-living starlings (Sturnus vulgaris) to provision their young with mealworms from artificial feeding stations. Manipulating the interval at which mealworms were released, Kacelnic was able to precisely control the shape of the resource acquisition curve; ever-longer intervals between individual prey items mimicked a diminishing return rate assumed in a patch-foraging model. After training, Kacelnik positioned the feeding stations at varying distances (8–600 meters) from the starlings’ nests to simulate variation in travel time between food patches, and he then quantified how many mealworms each starling brought back to the nest after each foraging trip. The prediction was clear: the farther away the feeding station was placed, the more prey items the starlings should bring back with every trip. And, this is exactly what Kacelnik found (Figure @ref(fig:optfor3)). In fact, the observed number of prey items closely followed the theoretical predictions made by the model.\n\n\n\n\n\nNumber of prey items collected by starlings as a function of travel time between food patches. The black like represents the theoretical prediction derived from the marginal value theorem in Figure 9.6. Data from Kacelnik (1984).\n\n\n\n\nThe few exemplar studies on adaptation discussed here illustrate the complementary insights that can be gained from observational studies grounded in ecological realities, experimental studies that control for confounding variables and help to identify causal relationships, and theoretical models that establish clear predictions based on first principles. While not all approaches are feasible in all study systems, addressing the same problem from different angles and looking for consistencies in the emerging solutions is critical to avoid premature conclusions about adaptation. Conflicting evidence on a given topic does not necessarily invalidate somebody’s work and conclusions; rather, it is just an indication that the context and intricacies of a particular trait (or its uses) are not yet fully understood and require additional investigation.\n\n\n\n15.1.3 Local Adaptation within Species\nPhenotypic variation is, of course, not only evident between species; there can be an extraordinary amount of phenotypic variation within and among populations of the same species as well. Just consider the staggering color variation among different populations of the stawberry poison-dart frog (Oophaga pumillio; Figure @ref(fig:intraspecvar)). Throughout its range, which spans from Nicaragua south to Panama, isolated populations exhibit completely different colors and patterns, even across very small geographic distances. While among-population variation is common in many species, the core question is why? What phenotypic differences reflect adaptation to local environmental conditions?\n\n\n\n\n\nIntraspecific variation observed in the poison dart frog Oophaga pumillio across islands of the Bocas del Toro Archipelago Panama. Note that Allobates talamancae is a nontoxic frog species that coexists with the other species.

Such correlations are often evident across vast geographic scales. For example, consistent with the predictions of Bergmann’s rule, many species exhibit a latitudinal gradient in body size. Populations of Drosophila subobscura, which is naturally distributed across Europe, exhibit a relatively small body size in southern portions of the species range around the Mediterranean Sea, while they get progressively larger toward the northern edge of the distribution in Germany and Denmark (Figure @ref(fig:droslat)A). Interestingly, a parallel cline in body shape has evolved in D. subobscura populations of North America, where the species was introduced in the early 1980s (Figure @ref(fig:droslat)A). As for comparative analyses among species, replication of trait-environment correlations can be evidence for the role of natural selection in the evolution of phenotypic gradients.\nTrait-environment correlations alone, however, are not sufficient to infer adaptation—even when similar phenotypic clines have repeatedly emerged along replicated environmental gradients. This is because natural selection is just one mechanisms by which such clines can emerge. Alternatively, the clinal expression of phenotypes can be a product of phenotypic plasticity, where individuals differ between populations simply due to exposure to distinct environmental conditions—and not because of differentiation at genetic loci controlling the expression of a trait. Consequently, common-garden experiments are necessary to disentangle the relative contributions of environmental and genetic variation to the phenotypic variation observed among populations. In common garden experiments, populations from different parts of a species’ range are exposed to the exact same environmental conditions to test whether traits differences observed in nature are retained under experimental conditions. Such common garden experiments in Drosophila melanogaster have shown that among-population variation in body size persists in the laboratory, although the slope of the regression line is reduced, suggesting that genetic differentiation and phenotypic plasticity both contribute to the observed phenotypic differences in nature (Figure @ref(fig:droslat)B).\nIt is also important to note that trait-environment correlations must not always occur over vast geographic distances, nor is phenotypic differentiation always gradual. For example, local adaptation of many plant species to different soil conditions can occur at very small spatial scales that are better measured in meters than kilometers, and yet they include discrete ecotypes that correspond to different soil types. Whether local adaptation leads to continuous gradients or discrete ecotypes depends on the strength, nature, and spatial distribution of natural selection, the genetic architecture underlying the focal traits, and the connectedness of populations through gene flow.\n\n\n\n\n\nA.

Body size variation of Drosophila melanogaster along a latitudinal gradient for wild-caught individuals and common-garden-reared individuals from the same populations. Data from Imasheva et al. (1994).\n\n\n\n\nA complementary approach to detecting local adaptation is the use of translocation or transplant experiments, where the performance of different phenotypes is compared under different environmental conditions. Such experiments allow us to determine how a particular phenotype performs in different habitats relative to its original home habitat, and they allow us to compare the performance of local phenotypes to foreign phenotypes from other habitats. Most clearly, evidence for local adaptation is uncovered when different phenotypes perform best in their home habitat, and if they simultaneously outperform any foreign phenotypes (Figure @ref(fig:locada)A). However, a particular phenotype does not need to perform best in its home environment as long as it is able to perform better than all other phenotypes (Figure @ref(fig:locada)B). This frequently happens in populations adapted to extreme environmental conditions. Specific adaptations allow them to tolerate adverse conditions and outcompete nonadapted individuals, but even so they still have a higher fitness in the absence of the stressor that they are uniquely adapted to. Conversely, superior performance of a phenotype in its home habitat does not make it locally adapted if it is outcompeted by other phenotypes (Figure @ref(fig:locada)C).\n\n\n\n\n\nPossible outcomes of translocation experiments. Red indicates the performance of inviduals from habitat A, green the performance of individuals from habitat B. In scenarios (A) and (B), local phenotypes outperform foreign phenotypes in their own habitat. In scenarios (A) and (C), phenotyoes perform better in their home habitat than in an away habitat. Note that only scenarios (A) and (B) are examples of local adaptation. Adopted from Kawecki & Ebert (2004).\n\n\n\n\nA classic system for the study of local adaptation to diverse environmental conditions is the mummichog (Fundulus heteroclitus), a small coastal fish species that can be found in both fresh and brackish waters. This distribution across a major ecotone naturally raises questions about whether these fish are locally adapted to different salinities, or if they can flexibly modify their physiology and perform equally well in either environment. Reid Brennan and his colleagues (2016) collected fish from fresh and brackish water populations and acclimated half of the individuals from each habitat to either fresh or brackish water in the laboratory. If mummichog are locally adapted, we would expect the brackish water fish to outperform freshwater fish in brackish water—irrespective of acclimation conditions—and vice versa. This exactly what the researchers found when they compared the endurance of fish swimming under different environmental conditions (Figure @ref(fig:fundperf)A). While the endurance of freshwater individuals was not significantly different across environments, the performance of brackish water fish differed dramatically depending on water type; they outperformed freshwater fish under high salinity conditions, and they were outperformed under low salinity conditions. Interestingly, another aspect of organismal performance—metabolic scope, which is a measure of energy organisms can mobilize after accounting for the minimum energy required to sustain life—showed a very different pattern (Figure @ref(fig:fundperf)B). Fish from both populations performed better in brackish than freshwater, and the fact that there were no population differences in this trait indicates that variation is induced by plasticity.\nSuch conflicting evidence is not unusual when we attempt to infer local adaptation by measuring organismal performance across different environmental conditions with different metrics. After all, among-population variation in one trait may be shaped primarily by genetic differentiation, while variation in another trait may be entirely plastic; after all, different traits likely have different genetic and developmental architectures. This complication highlights the importance of thinking critically about how we actually measure organismal performance and, ultimately, fitness. In natural systems, it is nearly impossible to directly measure fitness because of the complexity of phenotyes and selective regimes. Researchers often measure other aspects of organismal performance (growth, survival, endurance, etc.) as fitness proxies, which requires a careful examination of the assumptions we make about the relationships of different fitness proxies and actual fitness.\n\n\n\n\n\nA.

    "section": "15.2 Phenotypic Plasticity",
    "text": "15.2 Phenotypic Plasticity\nPhenotypic plasticity is the developmental response of a genotype to environmental cues. It introduces environmentally-induced phenotypic variation into populations (VE/VP; see Chapter 8). So far, we have primarily thought of plasticity as a complicating factor when we try to infer adaptation; populations in different environments may exhibit different phenotypes not because of genetic differentiation, but simply because of exposure to different environmental conditions. This is not an example of local adaptation, because plastic traits are not heritable, and adaptations are the product of evolution by natural selection, which requires trait heritability. Still, the ability to modify phenotypic expression in response to environmental cues may itself be considered an adaptation.\nConsider water fleas (Daphnia sp.) as an example. Many Daphnia species are able to plastically modify the size of defensive structures (e.g., tail and head spines) depending on whether they are sensing potential predators in their environment. In absence of predators, defensive structures are small to save the energy and nutrients required for their growth. In the presence of predators, however, the same clone of these asexually reproducing crustaceans will produce substantially longer spines, and the spiny appendages provide a fitness benefit despite of the resource costs, because they reduce the likelihood that an individual is preyed upon. In this case, it is not the actual size of the spine that is the adaptation (short in low-predation and long in high-predation environments). Instead, it is the ability to change spine size depending on the presence or absence of predators that is adaptive.\n\n\n\n\n\nDaphnia magna is a small planktonic crustacean. In this specimen, the tail spine is only weakly developed, and the head spine is missing.

All of these types of plasticity are the same in that they lead to alternative trait expression by the same genotype when exposed to different environmental conditions.\n\nDevelopmental Plasticity\nDevelopmental plasticity occurs when an environmental cue during a critical period—usually early during ontogeny—alters the developmental trajectory of an individual, leading to alternative phenotypic morphs in adults. The modification of phenotypes through developmental plasticity is non-reversible, and the traits of an individual remain fixed after the critical period has passed. Classical examples of developmental plasticity include the predator-dependent expression of defensive structures in Daphnia, the diet-dependent expression of omnivorous and carnivorous tadpoles in spadefoot toads, and the development of different casts in ants and other social insects.\n\n\nAcclimation\nAcclimation is a form of phenotypic plasticity that involves physiological or behavioral changes within the lifetime of an individual, and allows organisms to respond to short-term environmental changes. Unlike developmental plasticity, acclimation is reversible, and traits can be adjusted continuously throughout an individual’s life. A wide variety of physiological tolerances are subject to acclimation in plants and animals alike, including tolerance to extremes in temperature, salinity, or oxygen availability. Similarly, gastrointestinal tract morphology and physiology in many animals can change in response to variation in diet. Plants can also modify leaf shape and size depending on the availability of light or the presence of herbivores.\n\n\nSeasonal Plasticity\nSeasonal plasticity includes predictable phenotypic changes individuals experience over the course of the year, often leading to cyclical phenotypic changes over the course of an individual’s lifespan. Examples for seasonal plasticity includes coat color changes in snowshoe hares and Arctic foxes (brown in the summer, white in the winter), wet and dry-season color morphs observed in some African butterflies, and the seasonal growth and shedding of antlers in many ungulates.\n\n\n\n15.2.2 Reaction Norms and the Evolution of Plasticity\nIf phenotypic plasticity can be an adaptation, it must be the product of natural selection; hence, there must be heritable variation in plasticity within a population for plasticity to evolve. To quantitatively describe a genotype’s ability to plastically modify its phenotype in response to a particular environmental cue, we measure so-called reaction norms. A reaction norm describes the pattern of phenotypic expression of a single genotype as a function of an environmental variable. Reaction norms can have any shape (Figure @ref(fig:reactnorm)), and the exact nature of reaction norms can be determined empirically by rearing the same genotype in different environments and measuring phenotypic expression.\n\n\n\n\n\nA reaction norm describes how the phenotype of a particular genotype changes across different environments. In theory, reaction norms can have any shape; they can be close to linear (blue line) or completely non-linear.\n\n\n\n\nImportantly, reaction norms are quantitative traits. But before we can apply quantitative genetic approaches to understand the evolution of phenotypic plasticity, we need to amend the conceptual framework that we established in Chapter 9. For simplicity, let’s assume that we can describe phenotypic variation in a population with linear graphs, where differences in slopes reflect variation in plasticity and differences in intercepts indicate variation among genotypes . If phenotypic variation in a population is completely determined by genetic variation (VP=VG), the reaction norms for all genotypes in a population are flat (slope = 0), but with different y-intercepts (Figure @ref(fig:reactionnorms)A). In this case, it does not matter what the environment is; the phenotype is solely dependent on the genotype. In contrast, if phenotypic variation in a population is completely determined by environmental variation (VP=VE), all genotypes will have the same reaction norm (same slope and same intercept; Figure @ref(fig:reactionnorms)A). In this case, it does not matter what genotype an individual belongs to; phenotypic expression is solely dependent on the environment. If both genetic and environmental variation shape phenotypic variation in a population (VP=VG+VE), the shape (slope) of the plastic response is identical for all genotypes, but their intercepts vary (Figure @ref(fig:reactionnorms)C). What all three scenarios have in common is that none of them actually allow for the evolution of phenotypic plasticity. The evolution of the ability to plastically modify the expression of a trait is contingent on there being variation in that ability. I.e., there needs to be variation in plasticity, and all three scenarios we have discussed so far either have no plasticity in the population at all (Figure @ref(fig:reactionnorms)A), or all genotypes respond to different environments in the exact same way (Figure @ref(fig:reactionnorms)B–C).\nTo account for variation in reaction norms that allows for the evolution of phenotypic plasticity, we need to add another term our model: phenotypic variation that is the consequence of genotype-specific responses to environmental variation, also know as gene-by-environment interactions (VG⨉E). Hence, VP=VG+VE+VG⨉E. Gene-by-environment interactions are characterized by different genotypes having different slopes in their plastic responses (Figure @ref(fig:reactionnorms)D). Only when different genotypes have different reaction norms can natural selection act on that variation to optimize plastic responses in a way that maximizes fitness. In some contexts, that means that plasticity may be favored—for example when environmental conditions are fluctuating or unpredictable. When environments are stable, however, plasticity may be selected against.\n\n\n\n\n\nComponents of variation of a phenotypic trait: A. If VP=VG, there is no phenotypic plasticity in a population. B. If VP=VE, phenotypic variation is solely shaped by plasticity. C. If VP=VG+VE, genetic variation and phenotypic plasticity contribute to trait variation on a population, but all genotype respond to environmental cues in exactly the same way. D. If VP=VG+VE+VG⨉E, there are genotype-specific responses to environmental cues. This is the only scenario in which phenotypic plasticity can actually evolve.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n15.2.3 Adaptive and Maladaptive Phenotypic Plasticity\nPhenotypic plasticity can evolve when there is heritable variation in plasticity within populations. However, it would be premature to assume that all instances of plasticity are actually adaptive. Like all other traits, plasticity is not only shaped by natural selection, but also by other evolutionary forces. And like all other traits, plasticity is subject to pleiotropic interactions, constraints, and trade-offs that cause deviation from optimal phenotypes.\nPhenotypic plasticity is adaptive if it allows individuals to adjust their phenotype in a way that increases their fitness under the environmental conditions they encounter. Recognizing adaptive phenotypic plasticity, however, is not trivial in natural systems. Doughty and Reznick (2004) proposed six key questions that must be addressed to determine the adaptive value of plasticity: (1) What are the plastic responses to different environmental conditions? (2) How do environmental conditions that impact phenotypic expression vary in nature? This is important because conditions that can induce plasticity in the laboratory may actually be rare or non-existent in natural habitats. (3) Is there a reversal in relative fitness of the alternative phenotypes in different environments? (4) Do organisms respond to reliable environmental cues that predict future selective environments? (5) Is there genetic variation for plasticity and does it evolve in response to selection? (6) Is there comparative evidence that plasticity is correlated with environmental heterogeneity? Needless to say, rigorously ruling out alternative, non-adaptive explanations for adaptive plasticity is a tall order.\nOne of the best-studied cases of adaptive phenotypic plasticity comes from egg size variation in seed beetles (Stator limatus). These beetles lay their eggs on the seeds of different host plants, including cat-claw acacia (Acacia greggi) and blue paloverde (Cercidium floridum), which vary in their availability to different beetle populations. Acacia seeds provide a high-quality resource, and seed beetles can maximize their fitness by laying many small eggs. In contrast, the seeds of paloverde are of poor quality for the developing offspring, and fitness is maximized by laying a few large eggs (Fox & Mousseau 1996). As in many other instances where traits (eggs size and number in this case) and environments (host plants) vary among populations, correlations between the two variable can arise through local adaptation (i.e., genetic differentiation) or through phenotypic plasticity. To distinguish between these alternative hypotheses, Fox et al. (1997) first raised seed beetles on the preferred acacia seeds for multiple generations, to minimize potential maternal effects. They then let individual females lay their eggs on either acacia or paloverde seeds and measured the size of deposited eggs. As observed in nature, eggs laid on acacia seed were small, and those laid on paloverde were large (Figure @ref(fig:seedbeet)A). Even more so, females were actually able to adjust their eggs size within just a few days when the researchers switched them across experimental treatments (Figure @ref(fig:seedbeet)B). This combination of field and laboratory experiments not only revealed that beetles adjust their phenotypic trait in response to an environmental cue (question 1), but also that the relevant environmental factor varies in nature (differences in host plants among populations; question 2), and that the different phenotypes maximize fitness in their respective environment (question 3). Subsequent quantitative genetic studies also revealed genetic variation for plasticity within the seed beetle population (question 5; Fox et al. 1999).\n\n\n\n\n\nA. Egg size variation of seed beetles on different host plants (Acacia and Cercidium) B. Individual seed beetles are able to adjust eggs size rapidly when switched between the two hosts. Egg size and experimental data from Fox et al. 1997.\n\n\n\n\nAnother example illustrates how the adaptive value of phenotypic plasticity can be context-dependent. Many freshwater snails exhibit phenotypic plasticity in their shell growth depending on whether predators are present or absent. Physella virgata, for example, grows large and elongated shells in absence of predators and smaller and more rotund shells in the presence of fish. Smaller and rotund shells are harder to crush, providing added protection. On the other hand, they also constrain a snail’s body size, and along with that the size of the gonads and ultimately lifetime reproductive output. Interestingly, Physella virgata changes its shell morphology when it senses an actual threat in the environment (molluscivorous sunfish) and also when it senses fish that do not actually eat snails (Figure @ref(fig:snails)). While the plastic response may constitute an adaptation in an environment with molluscivorous fish, the lack of specificity in the environmental cue (see question 4 above) renders the same response maladaptive in other environmental contexts.\n\n\n\n\n\nShell size of the snail Physella virgata under fishless control conditions and in the presence of different fish species that vary in their propensity to consume snails as prey.

    "text": "16.1 Species and Species Concepts\nSpecies are a basic evolutionary unit. Species typically consist of multiple populations, each connected by gene flow but independently shaped by mutation, selection, and genetic drift. Hence, species form the boundary for the spread of alleles. While this notion of a species is in principle simple, determining those boundaries is not. As a consequence, biologists have developed a wide variety of species concepts that use more straightforward criteria to determine the species status of different populations (see below). All of these concepts have different strengths, weaknesses, and applicabilities; but rather than dissecting these, I will just leave it with Darwin’s slightly facetious insight, because nothing has really changed since 1859:\nI will say, however, that the biological species concept is the only species concept that recognizes and treats species as real natural entities. Classifications based on other species concepts are inevitably proxies, and as such, human constructs. This is not necessarily bad, because it provides the practicality needed for working with organisms—whether that is in biomedical research, argiculture, wildlife management, or conservation. It is just important to remember that species classifications do not always correspond precisely to actual biological species, a point we will return to later in this chapter.\nI will briefly provide more background information on the biological species concept. As the only species concept that recognizes species as real natural entities, the biological species is critical if we want to understand the speciation process; it sets the criteria for when the process is completed and a single lineage has split into two.",

    "text": "“I shall not discuss the various definitions which have been given of the term species. No one definition has as yet satisfied all naturalists; yet every naturalist knows vaguely what he means when he speaks of a species.”\nCharles Darwin\n\n\n\n\nSpecies Concepts: A Selection\nA wide variety of concepts have been proposed to recognize, describe, and classify biodiversity. To learn more about the history and debates surrounding different species concepts, check out the article “Species Concepts” by Kevin Zelnio.\nA selection of species concepts can be found below. Note that there have been concerted efforts in the recent past to unify different species concepts in an attempt to make species delimitation more consistent across taxonomic groups (De Queiroz 2007).\n\nBiological Species Concept: A species is a group of actually or potentially interbreeding natural populations, which are reproductively isolated from other such groups.\nCohesion Species Concept: A species is the most inclusive group of organisms having the potential for genetic and/or demographic exchangeability; a group of organisms having the potential for phenotypic cohesion through intrinsic mechanisms.\nCompetition Species Concept: A species is the most extensive units in the natural economy such that reproductive competition occurs among their parts.\nEcological Species Concept: A species is a set of organisms exploiting or adapted to a single niche (or adaptive zone).\nEvolutionary Species Concept: A species is a lineage (an ancestral-descendant sequence of populations) evolving separately from others and with its own unitary evolutionary roles, tendencies, and historical fate.\nGeneological Species Concept: A species is an exclusive group of organisms whose members more closely resemble one another than members of any outside group.\nGenetic Cluster Species Concept: A species is a group of individuals forming a distinct genotypic cluster without intermediates between other such clusters.\nIsolation Species Concept: A species is a system of populations, the gene exchange between which is prevented by absence of interbreeding between heterospecific organisms based on intrinsic properties.\nMorphological (or Phenetic) Species Concept: A species is a set of organisms that look similar to each other and is distinct from other sets.\nPhylogenetic Species concept: A species is the smallest monophyletic group distinguishable by shared derived (synapomorphic) characteristics.\nRecognition Species Concept: A species is is a group of individuals with a shared specific mate recognition or fertilization system.\nTypological Species Concept: A species is a group of organisms conforming to a common morphological plan, emphasizing the species as an essentially static, non-variable assemblage.\n\n\n\n16.1.1 The Biological Species Concept\nThe biological species concept was first proposed by Ernst Mayr, who defined a species as a group of actually or potentially interbreeding natural populations, which are reproductively isolated from other such groups. Hence, species are defined by reproductive compatibility, which is meaningful from an evolutionary perspective because it hinges on the lack of gene flow.\nIt is important to stress some nuances in this definition. First of all, Mayr explicitly emphasized natural populations in his definition, because the ability of two species to hybridize—especially outside of their typical ecological context—does not negate their species status. As we shall see, interspecific matings between many species can lead to perfectly viable and fertile offspring, yet such matings rarely occur in their natural environment due to the reproductive barriers that prevent individuals from different species from meeting or recognizing each other as potential mates. Thus, evidence of two species hybridizing outside of their ecological context, especially in captivity, does not mean that such hybridization would occur naturally.\nThe term “potentially interbreeding” also creates frequent misconceptions. It does not refer to potential interbreeding in artificial contexts, but to potential interbreeding in the face of physical barriers that prevent individuals from different populations meeting one another. Mayr argued that we are unable to determine the species status of allopatric populations, where interbreeding is currently impossible due to physical separation. What would happen if a physical barrier was removed? For example, consider the large ungulates of the genus Cervus that we know as wapiti (elk) and that Europeans know as red deer. There are three disjunct populations: one in North America, one in Europe and western Asia, and one in East Asia (Figure @ref(fig:wapiti)). Would animals from these different populations interbreed if their ranges reconnected, or would they remain separate, reproductively isolated species? Obviously there is no way to test this in practice, and our inability to determine the species status of allopatric populations is in fact one of the biggest shortcomings of the biological species concept. Hence, taxonomist have resorted to alternative species concepts in the case of wapiti and red deer. For a long time, the different populations were considered the same species (C. elaphus) based on their morphological similarity and shared evolutionary history. However, recent genetic analyses have restricted C. elpahus to the European and western Asian forms, and the east Asian and North American forms are classified as C. canadensis. Which is right? Well, it’s simply a matter of perspective, because such classifications are human constructs. Note that even in populations with adjacent or overlapping ranges, determining species status based on the biological species concept can be costly and time consuming, which is why in most cases biological classification operationally still hinges on other concepts.\n\n\n\n\n\nDistrubution of wapiti and red deer in North America and Eurasia. The species occurs in three disjunct populations. North American wapiti picture by Membeth (CC0); red deer picture by the Wasp Factory (CC BY-NC-SA 2.0); Asian wapiti picture by Membeth (CC0).\n\n\n\n\nFinally, it is important to mention that the biological species concept does not apply in contexts where reproductive compatibility cannot be assessed or simply does not exist. For example, we cannot determine reproductive isolation for extinct species that we only know from the fossil record. This contributes to a long-standing debate about how many species of humans roamed this planet in prehistoric times. Human fossils are classified based on morphological traits, and twelve species are recognized in the genus Homo alone. However, we just don’t know whether the different phenotypic variants represent a single, morphologically diverse species, or whether there were in fact multiple, reproductively isolated species of Homo coexisting at one time. Similarly, the biological species concept does not apply to organisms that reproduce asexually, because different asexual individuals—by definition—are reproductively isolated from all other individuals. If there is no sex and recombination, the spread of alleles is strictly limited from mothers to daughters, and there is no other exchange of genetic material among individuals or populations.",

    "text": "16.2 Speciation as a Gradual Process\nIf species are groups of actually or potentially interbreeding natural populations, which are reproductively isolated from other such groups, then speciation is the process by which reproductive isolation evolves between populations. The evolution of reproductive isolation is typically a gradual process, starting from a single variable population, continuing to differentiated populations that are still connected by gene flow, and finally ending in distinct and reproductively isolated species. This gradient is known as the speciation continuum (Figure @ref(fig:speccont2)). Note that movement along this speciation continuum can be bidirectional; lineages can split by accruing more and more reproductive isolation, but lineages can also merge together through hybridization.\nJust like the evolution of other traits, changes in the degree of reproductive isolation tend to evolve gradually through time, and we can consequently observe populations at different stages along the speciation continuum in natural systems. Such systems with ongoing speciation are valuable study objects for examining how and why reproductive isolation evolves.\n\n\n\n\n\nSpeciation is not typically an instantaneous process. Rather, species evolve gradually along a speciation continuum that ranges from a single population, to differentiated populations connected by gene flow, to distinct and reproductively isolated populations.\n\n\n\n\nNote that the gradual and dynamic nature of speciation is one reason for why taxonomic species may not align well with biological realities. Some natural populations can be strongly differentiated and diagnosable based on a number of other species concepts. At the same time, there may still be a lot of genes flow with other populations, and even slight changes in environmental conditions could counteract existing reproductive barriers and reverse the speciation process. In other words, not all aspects of nature can be neatly classified into different categories, and we have to contend with the fact that variation in nature is continuous because speciation is a gradual and not an instantaneous process.",

    "section": "16.3 Mechanisms of Reproductive Isolation",
    "text": "16.3 Mechanisms of Reproductive Isolation\nIf speciation is the evolution of reproductive isolation between populations, we first need to understand what mechanisms can mediate reproductive isolation. Only then can we consider how those mechanisms actually evolve. Broadly speaking, mechanisms of reproductive isolation can be categorized into three groups, depending on whether they prevent mating between individuals from different populations (pre-mating isolation), whether they prevent successful fertilization and the formation of a zygote (post-mating, pre-zygotic isolation), or whether they prevent the success of interpopulation hybrids (post-zygotic isolation). In this section, we will discuss some common mechanisms of reproductive isolation using illustrative examples from empirical studies.\n\n16.3.1 Pre-Mating Isolation\nPre-mating isolation describes reproductive barriers that reduce the frequency or success of interpopulation mating. This can happen because members of different populations do not meet, do not recognize each other, or are not compatible with each other during mating.\n\nEcological Isolation\nEcological isolation reduces the probability that members of different populations encounter each other, for example as consequence of adaptation to different niches that causes spatial segregation of population. Such spatial segregation can occur at large spatial scales (e.g., adaptation to different habitat types) or at small spatial scales (e.g., adaptation to different host plants that grow in the same habitat patch). Two mechanisms can maintain spatial segregation between populations:\n\nSpatial segregation can be a consequence of selection against migrants, where individuals that disperse across habitats have a reduced survivability, and, thus, a lower likelihood of encountering potential mates. Such selection against migrants is evident in desert spiders (Agelenopsis aperta) that have adapted to different habitat types. Woodland spiders are limited by web-sites and prey, and are selected for bold and aggressive behaviors toward prey and conspecifics alike. In contrast, riparian spider populations are released from competition but suffer from increased predation by birds, favoring more shy and reclusive behaviors (Riechert & Hall 2000). Experimental translocation of spiders between woodland and riparian habitats have indicated selection against migrants, as individuals moved across habitats had significantly lower survival rates than individuals translocated within habitat types (Figure @ref(fig:habiso)A). Hence, any spiders that would naturally move across habitat boundaries would be selected against, reducing the likelhood of cross-population mating.\nSpatial segregation can also be a consequence of differential habitat preferences. When individuals from locally adapted populations choose habitats based on suitability, interpopulation encounter rates can be low even in absence of strong selection against migrants. For example, stickleback fish (Gasterosteus aculeatus) locally adapted to either lake or stream habitats have a strong affinity to their particular habitat type (Bolnick et al. 2009). Over 80 % of marked individuals that were released at the confluence of a stream and a lake were eventually recaptured in their habitat of origin (Figure @ref(fig:habiso)B). They segregated spatially simply because of divergent behavioral preferences.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA. Translocation experiments in desert spiders (Agelenopsis aperta) across habitats reveals selection again migrants; translocated spiders exhibit significantly lower survival than residents in each habitat. Data from Riechert and Hall (2000). B. Sticklebacks (Gasterosteus aculeatus) adapted to lake and stream habitats exhibit a strong behavioral preference for their habitat of origin. Data from Bolnick et al. (2009).\n\n\n\n\nSegregation of populations can also occur temporally, when members of different populations are (reproductively) active during different times of the day or year. Evidence for temporal isolation comes from many flowering plants, insects, and amphibians. For example, three species of frog in the Rana pipiens complex have largely allopatric distributions, but their ranges overlap in parts of Texas and Oklahoma. In allopatric populations, the breeding seasons of all three species also overlap: all three species have coincident peaks in their breeding activity in the spring, and two species (R. sphenocephala and R. berlandieri) again in the fall (Figure @ref(fig:tempiso)). However, at sites where the three species occur sympatrically, each species has evolved a unique temporal niche, and peak breeding activities do not overlap: R. sphenocephala breeds in early spring, R. blairi in late spring, and R. berlandieri late summer and into fall. The secondary peaks in breeding activity of allopatric R. sphenocephala and R. berlandieri have disappeared completely in sympatry (Figure @ref(fig:tempiso)). So, even as members of the three species occupy the same habitats, the likelihood of interbreeding is significantly reduced because they are not thinking about reproduction at the same time.\n\n\n\n\n\nThree species in the Rana pipiensis complex have largely overlapping breeding seasons when they occur in allopatry. However, when they coexist in the same location, breeding seasons shift such that each species is temporally isolated. Data from Hillis (1981).\n\n\n\n\nFinally, a form of ecological isolation that is important for reproductive isolation in plants is pollinator isolation. Pollinator isolation occurs when animal pollinators do not transfer pollen between plants of different populations, usually as a consequence of coevolution between floral traits and pollinator preferences. For example, two closely related species of columbines (Aquilegia formosa and A. pubescens) coexist in the same habitat, but they have different flower colors and morphologies that attract different species. A. formosa has red, hanging flowers, while A. pubescens has white, erect flowers (Figure @ref(fig:polliiso)A and B). Since the red flowers are primarily visited by hummingbirds and the white flowers by hawkmoths, pollen is primarily distributed from A. formosa to A. formosa and from A. pubescens to A. pubenscens, while interspecific fertilization is rare @ref(fig:polliiso)C). Other groups of plants have diverged in flower coloration along a yellow-red gradient, exploiting differences in the visual systems of insect pollinators (with biases for yellow and UV) and bird pollinators (with biases for red).\n\n\nBehavioral isolation\nBehavioral isolation occurs when individuals from different populations do not recognize each other as potential mates. For example, populations may differ in species-recognition mechanisms, where changes in a particular signal (e.g., the chemical composition of a pheromone or the color for a visual signal) alters the perception of individuals as con- vs. heterospecific, or their attractiveness during mate choice. Behavioral isolation is evident in many species of birds (especially based on song), fishes (especially based on coloration), and insects (especially based on chemical signals).\nHeliconius butterflies are an example of behavioral isolation. Sympatric species are able to produce fertile offspring, but they typically do not hybridize because of assortative mating preferences. Males of the sympatric H. cydno (Figure @ref(fig:behiso)A) and H. melpomene (Figure @ref(fig:behiso)B), for example, almost exclusively court females of their own species (Figure @ref(fig:behiso)C). Hence, the existence of species-specific signals and matching mating preferences can significantly reduce the probability of gene flow among closely related species.\n\n\nMechanical isolation\nMechanical isolation occurs when individuals of two populations meet, recognize each other as potential mates, and attempt to copulate, but copulations are unsuccessful because of some mechanical incompatibility. Mechanical incompatibilities can be caused by size-mismatches between populations, or because of genital incompatibilities that arise through genital coevolution. Coevolution of male and female genital traits can arise through a variety of mechanisms, including sexual conflict (see Chapter 10). As consequence, genitals in many animal groups evolve and diversify rapidly, with stark differences even among closely related species. Compatibility of male and female genitalia have been likened to a lock-and-key mechanisms, where the males’ “key” will only fit species-specific female “locks”. Accordingly, heterospecific matings would not lead to successful sperm transfer and fertilization even when copulation is attempted. Mechanical isolation can also occur in plants, when closely related species have stamens and styles in different configurations. For example, black sage (Salvia mellifera) have stamens and style positioned along the upper lip of the flower; hence, pollen is transferred from flower to flower on the backs of small pollinating bees. In contrast, the syntopic white sage (S. apiana) exhibits two long stamens and a long, forked style that extends out and away from the flower. This configuration primarily transfers pollen to the wings of larger carpenter and bumble bees. So even if the same pollinator visits flowers of both species, successful transfer of pollen from one species to the style of the other species is unlikely.\nAnother fascinating example of mechanical isolation comes from evolution experiments using feather lice. These avian parasites must be small enough to fit between the feather barbs of their host to avoid being removed during preening. On the other hand, there is selection for larger body size due to the higher fecundity of larger individuals. Since larger hosts also have a larger distance between the barbs of their feathers, there is a correlation between host and parasite body size. Scott Villa and his colleagues investigated the evolution of feather lice (Columbicola columbae) on domesticated pigeons (Columba livia) of different body size over a period of four years (60 louse generations). As expected, lice that lived on large hosts evolved a larger body size over this period of time. Interestingly, this also led to the evolution of mechanical isolation between lice from large hosts and lice from small hosts. While males were still eager to mate with females of the other strain, size mismatched individuals were unable to copulate effectively with each other (check out the videos of a mating of a size-matched pair, a male of the large strain trying to copulate with a female of the small strain, and a male of the small strain trying to copulate with a female of the large strain). These mismatches resulted in reduced copulation times, a reduced probability of egg production, and a reduced number of offspring produced in interlineage matings (Figure @ref(fig:copiso)). Hence, mechanical incompatibility has the capacity to reduce gene flow between populations adapted to different host sizes.\n\n\n\n\n\nEven though male feather lice (Columbicola columbae) of different sized lineages attempt to copulate with females that are too large or too small (as indicated by point outside of the gray shaded area), those copulations are not necessrily successful. A. Lice within the typical range of sexual size dimorphism exhibited longer copulation duration compared to matings between individuals with large size disparities. Data from Villa et al. (2019). B. Lice within the typical range of sexual size dimorphism were more likely to produced eggs when kept in experimental vials. Data from Villa et al. (2019). C. Lice within the typical range of sexual size dimorphism were more likely to produced offspring on a natural host. Data from Villa et al. (2019).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n16.3.2 Post-Mating, Pre-zygotic Isolation\nPost-mating, prezygotic isolation describes reproductive barriers that reduce the frequency or success of inter-population fertilization, if mating between members of different populations has occurred. Post-mating prezygotic isolation mechanisms can be associated with sperm competition and cryptic female choice, or—most importantly—with a gametic incompatibilities.\n\nGametic Isolation\nGametic isolation occurs when male and female gametes cannot merge to form a zygote. Such gametic incompatibilities are frequently mediated by interactions of proteins on the surface of eggs and sperm. Co-evolution of sperm and egg surface proteins can create a lock-and-key mechanism, just like co-evolution of male and female genitalia. Gametic isolation is particularly well-studied in aquatic broadcast spawners (e.g., in Porifera, Cnidaria, and Echinodermata), where individuals release their gametes directly into the water, which of course limits the possibility for pre-mating isolation. For example, there are strong gametic incompatibilities among populations of a tropical sea urchin, Echinometra mathaei (Palumbi & Metz 1991). Mixing eggs and sperm from different populations clearly indicates high fertilization rates when eggs are encountering sperm from the same population, irrespective of sperm concentration (Figure @ref(fig:urch)). In contrast, only 2-9 % of eggs were fertilized when sperm and eggs of different populations were combined. Hence, chemical interactions between eggs and sperm can be critical for determining the degree of reproductive isolation between populations. It is important to note that gametic isolation can also contribute to reproductive isolation between populations of species with other reproductive modes—including some with internal fertilization; however, mechanisms mediating gametic incompatibilities in those taxa are not as thoroughly investigated.\n\n\n\n\n\nxxx. Data from Palumbi and Metz (1991).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n16.3.3 Post-Zygotic Isolation\nPost-zygotic isolation occurs when individuals from different populations mate successfully and their gametes form a zygote that starts to develop, but the resulting hybrids have reduced fitness compared to either of the parents. Reduced hybrid fitness can be caused by both intrinsic and extrinsic factors.\n\nIntrinsic Incompatibilities\nIntrinsic hybrid incompatibilities are reductions in hybrid fitness that are independent of environmental conditions. Intrinsic barriers primarily arise due to epistatic effects and are also known as genetic incompatibilities. Such incompatibilities can be severe and cause hybrid inviability, where the development of hybrids ceases at early stages, long before such individuals are born. In other cases, genetic incompatibilities cause hybrid sterility (e.g., sterility in mules, which are hybrids between horses and donkeys), or quantitative reductions in hybrid survival or reproduction.\nGenetic incompatibilities can arise through coevolution of different genes that contribute to the same protein complex or the sample physiological pathway. For example, enzymes involved the mitochondrial respiratory chain are protein complexes composed of amino acid chains derived from both the nuclear and mitochondrial genomes, and different protein subunits need to be compatible and work together to form a functional protein. Evolutionary change in one subunit may consequently be accompanied by corresponding changes in other subunits. Breaking up such co-evolved gene complexes during hybridization, where an individual might inherit the mitochondria from one parent but nuclear subunits from another, can cause issues with protein complex assembly or function, ultimately leading to mitochondrial, cellular, and organismal dysfunctions. These cases of genetic incompatibilities are also known as mito-nuclear incompatibilities.\nAnother well-studied example of a genetic incompatibility occurs through the coevolution of tumor and tumor-suppression genes in swordtail fishes of the genus Xiphophorus. X. malinche has a tumor gene with low activity and a matching tumor-suppressor gene with low activity, while X. birchmanni has a tumor gene with high activity and a matching tumor suppressor gene with high activity (Powell et al. 2020). Hybridization can disrupt the balance between tumor genes and their suppressors. Particularly, X. malinche and X. birchmanni hybrids that inherit at least one high activity tumor allele from X. birchmanni (on chromosome 21) and only low activity tumor-suppressor genes from X. malinche (on chromosome 5) have an increased chance of developing invasive melanocytes, which cause melanoma (a form of skin cancer; Figure @ref(fig:xiph)A). Mismatches of tumor and tumor-suppressor genes in hybrids have clear consequences for hybrid phenotypes and fitness. For example, hybrids exhibit larger melanistic spots on their tails (Figure @ref(fig:xiph)B), and—consistent with the higher invasiveness of melanocytes—their caudal spots grow faster and larger over time (Figure @ref(fig:xiph)C). In addition, the frequency of fish with a caudal spot deceases across age classes in hybrid populations, indicating that individuals with spots are selected against (Figure @ref(fig:xiph)D). This decrease is particularly evident in hybrid populations with a higher caudal spot frequency (populations hybrid 2 and 3 in Figure @ref(fig:xiph)D), where the high-activity tumor gene derived from X. birchmanni is more common.\n\n\n\n\n\nA. Frequency of invasive melanocytes in Xiphophorus fish with different genotypes at a tumor suppressor locus (on chromosome 5) and tumor locus (on chromosome 21). Only fish that are homozygous for the low activity tumor suppressor allele from X. malinche and have at least one tumor allele from X. birchmanni develop a high frequency of invasive tumor cells. Data from Powell et al. (2020). B. Caudal spot frequencies in parental X. birchmanni and X. malinche populations, and natural populations with hybridization between the two species (Hybrid 1-3). Data from Powell et al. (2020). C. Caudal spots grow faster and larger in hybrids compared to X. birchmanni. Data from Powell et al. (2020). D. The decrease in caudal spot frequency from juveiles to adults in two populations of Xiphophorus hybrids indicate an increased mortality of fish with a caudal spot. Data from Powell et al. (2020).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExtrinsic Incompatibilities\nExtrinsic incompatibilities occur when hybrids face reduced fitness because of a mismatch between their phenotype and their abiotic or biotic environment. In this case, hybrids are generally viable and fertile under laboratory conditions, but are ecologically inviable under natural conditions— either because they cannot tolerate the stressful environmental conditions that periodically arise in nature, or because they are competitively inferior to either parent in their respective niche. For example, some North American postglacial lakes harbor two species of stickleback (Gasterosteus aculeatus): a smaller limnetic species that lives in the open water and primarily feeds on zooplankton, and a larger benthic species that lives in the littoral zone and feeds on macroinvertebrates (Schluter 1995). Hybrids between the two species are viable and fertile. However, cage experiments in natural habitats revealed that hybrids are ecologically inferior compared to either parental species in the parents’ native habitat; hybrids have a lower growth rate than benthic stickleback in the littoral zone and also have a lower growth rate than the limnetic parents in open water (Figure @ref(fig:hybsel)A). Hence, ecological selection limits hybrid success in the natural context.\nHybrids may also be behaviorally sterile. Behavioral sterility may arise by hybrids not recognizing members of either parental species as potential mates, or because they themselves are not recognized as potential mates. In other words, behavioral sterility in hybrids is a consequence mismatched signals involved in species recognition, mate choice, and associated mating preferences. An example of reduced hybrid fitness caused by mate choice comes from the same Heliconius butterflies that we already discussed in the context of behavioral isolation. Heliconius melpomene females—and to a lesser degree those of H. cydno—exhibit mating preferences for males of their own species, as opposed to F1 hybrid males stemming from a cross between the two species (Figure @ref(fig:hybsel)B). Notably, however, females of both species also prefer to mate with hybrids over males from the opposite species, indicating that behavioral sterility is not complete.\n\n\n\n\n\nA. Ecological selection against hybrids as evidenced in stickleback (Gasterosteus aculeatus). Hybrids between benthic and limnetic stickleback have lower growth rates than either parent in their native habitat. Data from Schluter (1995). B. Sexual selection against hybrids as evidenced in Heliconius butterflies. Females of H. cydno and especially H. melpomene tend to avoid hybrid males during mate choice. Data from Naisbit et al. (2001).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n16.3.4 Reproductive Isolation as a Complex Trait\nIt is important to note that different mechanisms of reproductive isolation are not mutually exclusive. Between any population pair, many mechanisms may coincide such that total reproductive isolation is a composite of mechanisms that reduce the probability of mating between different populations, reduce the probability of fertilization should mating happen, and reduce the success of hybrids should fertilization happen. More over, as we will see below, the evolution of one reproductive isolation mechanism can profoundly impact the evolution of other reproductive barriers. Hence, it many natural systems it is critical not to just examine different mechanisms in isolation, but to also consider how different mechanisms interact to keep gene pools separated from one another.\n\n\n\n\n\nDifferent mechanisms of reproductive isolation often act in concert and can influence each other evolutionarily.",

    "section": "16.4 The Evolution of Reproductive Isolation",
    "text": "16.4 The Evolution of Reproductive Isolation\nNow that we have examined what mechanisms can cause reproductive isolation between populations, we can ask how those isolating barriers actually arise. Understanding how different evolutionary forces impact the evolution of reproductive isolation ultimately sheds light on the speciation process. We will consider three distinct scenarios: (1) Polyploidization and the evolution of instantaneous reproductive isolation, (2) allopatric speciation that includes periods of geographical separation between populations, and (3) ecological speciation, where reproductive isolation between populations can arise as a byproduct of adaptation even in the presence of ongoing gene flow.\n\n16.4.1 Polyploidization and Instantaneous Speciation\nPolyploidization is a form of mutation that leads to the duplication of entire genomes, typically due to meiotic errors leading to unreduced gametes. Fertilization of unreduced gametes with other unreduced gametes causes the formation of fertile polyploid lineages (i.e., from diploid to tetraploid, from tetraploid to octoploid, etc.) (Figure @ref(fig:polploid)A). Polyploid lineages are immediately isolated from their ancestral lineage because of dysfunctional chromosome complements in crosses between individuals of different ploidy. Such auto-polyploid speciation is particularly common in plants and other organisms for which self-fertilization is possible, because the combination of two unreduced gametes is a strong limiting factor in the formation of polyploids. Accordingly, up to 4 % of plant species are thought to have arisen through auto-polyploid speciation (Figure @ref(fig:polploid)B), while this phenomenon is rare in animals.\nPolyploid speciation can also occur through the combination of two genomes derived from different species, a process called allo-polyploid speciation (Figure @ref(fig:polploid)C). In this case, an unreduced gamete of one species is fertilized with a normal gamete from another, creating a hybrid with an uneven number of chromosomes. When unreduced gametes from that hybrid are then fertilized by a normal gamete from the second species, a fertile hybrid with the full genome set of each parent arises. Allo-polyploidy is extremely common in plants, and about 80 % of plant species may be allo-polyploids by some estimations. The common bread wheat (Triticum aestivum), for example, is an allo-hexaploid that contains three distinct sets of chromosomes from three different species of grass in the genus Aegilops. Similarly, various vegetables in the cabbage family (mustard, collard greens, cauliflower, kale, bok choi, rape seed, etc.) represent different allo-polyploid combinations of three species, Brassica nigra, B. rapa, and B. olarecea. In contrast, allo-polyploids are rare among animals, but some cases have been documented in insects, fish, amphibians, and reptiles.\n\n\n\n\n\nA. Auto-polyploidization occurs through the combination of two unreduced gametes, which usually occirs through self-fertilization. The resulting ployploids are instantaneously isolated from ancestral lineages with lower ploidy. B. Blackberries of the genus Rubus represent a polyploid species complex, including species with 2, 4, 8, 16, and 32 sets of chromosomes. Without genetic or cytological analyses, species with different ploidy levels are almost impossible to distinguish. C. Allo-polyploidization oocurs through the combination of two genomes derived from different species. It is a multi-step process that first involves the production of hybrids with uneven chromosome sets.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n16.4.2 Allopatric Speciation and Hybridization\nThe allopatric speciation model was first introduced by Ernst Mayr in his seminal book Systematics and the Origin of Species. This model postulates that the speciation process unfolds in three distinct steps: (1) The subdivision of an initial population through a geographic barrier, (2) population divergence in isolation, and (3) secondary contract of incipient species. In the following sections, we will examine these three steps in detail, along with pertinent examples.\n\nExplore More: Systematics and the Origin of Species\nErnst Mayr’s book “Systematics and the Origin of Species” is available for free through archive.org.\n\n\nGeographic Isolation\nAn initial stage of geographic isolation is central to the allopatric speciation model. Geographic isolation drives reproductive isolation and limits the spread of alleles within the separate populations. Two mechanisms can create geographically isolated populations from an initial ancestor: dispersal and vicariance.\nDispersal occurs when individuals of an original population overcome an existing geographic barrier and colonize a new and previously unoccupied habitat (Figure @ref(fig:dispersal)A). Classic examples of dispersal occur during the colonization of new oceanic islands. For example, the Hawai’ian archipelago arose as Earth’s crust moved over a volcanic hot spot from east to west. Accordingly, the western most island (Kaua’i; ~4.2–5 million years old) is the oldest, and islands get progressively younger towards the east; Hawai’i, as the youngest island, rose out of the ocean only 0.3–1.0 million years ago. Drosophila fruitflies that colonized the archipelago early during its formation provide a formidable example of dispersal. For two independent clades within the genus, the sequence of phylogenetic divergence corresponds to the sequence in which different islands arose from the ocean. In the D. planitibia subgroup (green clade in Figure @ref(fig:dispersal)B), dispersal occurred from O’ahu to Maui to Hawai’i; in the D. mitchelli, subgroup dispersal occurred from O’ahu to Moloka’i to Hawai’i. This pattern is consistent with the idea that species diversified through step-wise colonization of new habitats as they became available. Similar processes also gave rise to the diversity we observe in other oceanic archipelagos, like the Galapagos. It is important to emphasize that dispersal across geographic barriers and colonization of novel habitats is important in other ecological contexts as well. For example, lakes are the terrestrial equivalent of oceanic islands. Species may also overcome mountain ranges that separate suitable habitats, or valleys that separate mountain tops. Furthermore, island-like situations occur in the apparently well-connected habitats within oceans. For example, patches of coral reefs or deep-sea hydrothermal vents are separated by vast stretches of unsuitable habitats, which migrants must overcome.\n\n\n\n\n\nA. Dispersal is the colonization of a new habitat across a geographic barrier. B. Patterns of diversification in Drosophila fruitflies are consistent with dispersal. In two clades (green and orange), the sequence of species divergence corresponds to colonization of younger islands in the archipelago (adopted from Obbard et al. 2012). The inset photo shows D. silvestris (KarlM, CC BY-SA 3.0).\n\n\n\n\nVicariance occurs when the distributional range of a species is subdivided by an emerging geographic barrier (Figure @ref(fig:vicariance)A). For example, islands—or even entire continents—may be divided as a consequence of rising sea levels associated with climate change; as water levels flood low laying valleys, regions with higher elevations become separated. Similarly, volcanic activity and plate tectonics can shift land masses and create novel barriers of unsuitable habitat across which movement of organisms becomes limited. For example, the ancestor of ratites, which includes a number of flightless birds, had a Gondwanian distribution. As the supercontinent broke up into smaller pieces and landmasses drifted apart, geographic isolation gave rise to today’s flightless birds in South America, Africa, Australia and New Guinea, and New Zealand (Figure @ref(fig:vicariance)B). Other classic examples of vicariance include paired species of crustaceans, fish, and other marine animals that occur in either side of the Central American land bridge (i.e., sister species in the Pacific and the Caribbean) and in the Atlantic and the Mediterranean Sea.\n\n\n\n\n\nA. Vicariance is the subsetting of an original population by an emerging geographic barrier B. Patterns of diversification in ratites are a consequence of vicariance. The ancestral, contiguous range of this group on Gondwana was broken apart as a consequence of continental drift.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPopulation Divergence\nThe second step of the allopatric speciation model is population divergence in isolation. Such population divergence was long thought to be driven primarily by mutation and genetic drift; different sets of mutations arise and drift to fixation in each of the isolated populations, ultimately causing them to diverge. However, it is now well-recognized that natural and sexual selection also play a critical role in driving the differentiation of isolated populations. Differences in abiotic and biotic environmental conditions can drive local adaptation, potentially causing substantial phenotypic and genetic differences between populations. Thus, divergent selection can accelerate population divergence, though it is not requisite for allopatric speciation to occur.\n\n\nSecondary Contact and Reproductive Isolation\nThe fate of populations that diverged in isolation is determined in the third stage of the allopatric speciation model. When populations come into secondary contact after the initial period of isolation, there is an entire range of potential outcomes. Divergent populations are often referred to as incipient species at this stage.\nIf divergence between incipient species was relatively minor and does not affect their ability to interbreed, secondary contact may simply cease the speciation process. In this case, the two lineages hybridize and fuse back together into a single panmictic population.\nAlternatively, at least some degree of reproductive isolation may have accrued between incipient lineages. Consistent with the idea that drift was critical in driving population divergence, genetic incompatibilities were long thought to be a primary mechanism of reproductive isolation. In particular, secondary contact and hybridization between incipient species brings together alleles that previously drifted to fixation in the isolated lineages, and some of the new allelic combinations can be deleterious due to negative epistatic interactions (Figure @ref(fig:dmincomp)). Such genetic incompatibilities that reduce hybrid fitness upon secondary contact are also known as Dobzhansky-Muller incompatibilities.\nThere are two more important points to make here: (1) Dobzhansky-Muller incompatibilities do not only arise as a consequence of population differences that evolved through genetic drift. Alternate alleles that rise to high frequencies in different populations through divergent selection can also be subject to negative epistatic interactions and cause reductions in hybrid fitness. So, while the Dobzhansky-Muller model was primarily developed under the assumption that mutation and genetic drift are the primary drivers of population divergence, the model also applies when other evolutionary forces contribute to population differentiation. (2) Reproductive isolation between incipient species can not only be mediated by genetic incompatibilities (intrinsic post-zygotic isolation), but by any other mechanism of reproductive isolation as well. Evolution in isolation may have inadvertent consequences on ecological, behavioral, and morphological traits, which then affect the probability of mating and successful fertilization between incipient species. In addition, though there may be no genetic incompatibilities that limit hybrid success, hybrids may still be selected against by natural or sexual selection.\n\n\n\n\n\nDobzhansky-Muller incompatibilities arise as a consequence of evolution in geographic isolation. Specifically, new sets of mutations arise in geographic isolation and eventually drift to fixation. Upon secondary contact, recombination of these new alleles in hybrids can be subject to negative epistatic interactions. The novel alleles a and b have no evolutionary history of interacting, and if the alleles are incompatible, hybrid fitness is reduced.\n\n\n\n\nIrrespective of what mechanisms mediate reproductive isolation between incipient species, reproductive isolation is rarely complete upon secondary contact, as evidenced by the commonality of hybridization in nature. Hybridization, in these cases, is not evidence that incipient species are not species, but rather that the speciation process is still ongoing and has yet to be completed. Ultimately, there are three alternative outcomes upon secondary contact besides complete fusion of the the incipient species: completion of the speciation process through reinforcement, stable hybrid zones of contact, and hybrid speciation.\n\nReinforcement and the Completion of the Speciation Process\nReductions of hybrid fitness upon secondary contract—whether caused by genetic incompatibilities or by natural or sexual selection against hybrids—should exert direct selection on assortative mating preferences in both incipient species. Individuals that exhibit preferences for mating partners from their own incipient species and discriminate against heterospecifics ultimately have higher fitness, because they avoid producing unfit hybrid offspring. The process of natural selection increasing the degree of reproductive isolation between incipient species is known as reinforcement. In practice, reinforcement often leads to reproductive character displacement, where differences in reproductive traits—both in terms of signals and the corresponding preferences—are accentuated whenever closely related species coexist. A particular trait may be similar between two species in allopatry, but starkly differentiated in sympatry (Figure @ref(fig:reinforcement)). In the end, reproductive character displacement strengthens pre-zygotic reproductive isolation and can lead to the completion of the speciation process.\n\n\n\n\n\nReinforcement can lead to reproductive character displacement, where differences between species are accentuated in sympatry.\n\n\n\n\nThe importance of reinforcement in maintaining species boundaries upon secondary contact has been studied in Ficedula flycatchers, a group of small, Old World songbirds. Allopatric populations of the collared flycatcher (F. albicollis) and the pied flycatcher (F. hypoleuca) both exhibit black and white plumage and look almost identical to the untrained eye (Figure @ref(fig:piefly)A and B). However, the two species are very easy to tell apart when they co-occur in sympatry, because the pied flycatchers are actually brown and white (Figure @ref(fig:piefly)C). A series of elegant behavioral experiments has revealed how these changes in plumage coloration are a consequence of reinforcement (Sætre et al. 1997). It turns out that plumage similarities not only make it difficult for humans to distinguish allopatric populations of collared and pied flycatchers; one third of matings actually occur between species when females from sympatric populations have a choice between the allopatric color morphs of the two species. This finding is in stark contrast to the strong assortative mating observed when females can choose between males of sympatric color morphs (Figure @ref(fig:piefly)D). Consequently, differences in plumage coloration reduce the probability of hybridization, as predicted by the reinforcement hypothesis. Moreover, experiments with female pied flycatchers have revealed evidence for the evolution of mating preferences between sympatric and allopatric populations. While sympatric females prefer males with the brown plumage of sympatric males, allopatric females prefer to mate with males that exhibit the characteristically black plumage of allopatric males (Figure @ref(fig:piefly)E). Hence, reinforcement has not only acted on a signal for species recognition and caused character displacement in male plumage coloration, but it has also acted on the corresponding female preference to increase pre-zygotic reproductive isolation.\n\n\nHybrid Zones\nSecondary contact between incipient species can lead to stable hybrid zones in geographically restricted areas where lineages meet and cross-breed. Stable hybrid zones can either be maintained in so-called “tension zones”, or in areas of bounded hybrid superiority.\nTension zones are geographic regions where continuous dispersal and hybridization between parental species is balanced by selection against hybrids. Although hybrids are continuously produced, the integrity of species boundaries is largely maintained, because hybrids have lower fitness than either parental species and are continuously selected against. It is important to note, however, that backcrossing between hybrids and parentals can lead to the the introgression of neutral and adaptive alleles between species.\nIn contrast, the bounded hybrid superiority hypothesis postulates that hybrids have a higher fitness than either of the parental species in environments that are intermediate to those typically occupied by the parentals. In this case, hybrid zones are expected particularly along environmental gradients that separate the niches of the parental species. For example, hybrids between the two swordtail fishes X. malinche (a high elevation species) and X. birchmanni (a low elevation species) primarily occur at intermediate elevations. Hybrids have a higher heat tolerance than X. malinche and a higher cold tolerance than X. birchmanni, which allows them to outcompete either of the parental species at at intermediate elevations, where it gets too hot for X. malinche in the summer and too cold for X. birchmanni in the winter.\n\n\nHybrid Speciation\nLast but not least, hybridization upon secondary contact can lead to homoploid hybrid speciation; i.e., the formation a new species, reproductively isolated from both parentals but without a change in ploidy levels. While not common, such hybrid speciation has been documented in insects, fishes, amphibians, birds, and even a marine mammal (the clymene dolphin, Stenella clymene, which arose through hybridization between spinner dolphin, S. longirostris, and striped dolphin, S. coeruleoalba).\nAnother notable example of hybrid speciation includes the Darwin’s finches on Daphne Major Island in the Galapagos Archipelago, which we studied in detail in Chapter 2 and Chapter 3. In the 1980s, a male Española cactus finch (Geospiza conirostris) dispersed to Daphne Major and bred with female medium ground finches (G. fortis) that were already there. This hybridization event gave rise to a new lineage (also known as big bird lineage due to its size), which is endemic to Daphne Major and reproductively isolated from the other species that occur on the island.\n\nExplore More: Big Bird and Hybrid Speciation\nTo learn more about the fantastic tale of hybrid speciation in Darwin’s finches as directly observed by humans, check out Jordana Cepelewicz’ article “New Bird Species Arises from Hybrids, as Scientists Watch” in Quanta Magazine.\n\n\n\n\n\n16.4.3 Ecological Speciation\nThe allopatric speciation model dominated our understanding of the speciation process for over half a century. But with the rise of genetic tools, there was increasing evidence for sister species that occur in the same location without apparent periods of geographic separation. New species—it seemed—were also arising without physical separation, a process known as sympatric speciation. The big question, however, was how reproductive isolation can evolve between diverging populations when ongoing gene flow keeps homogenizing gene pools.\nBoth theoretical models and empirical evidence have since revealed that speciation with gene flow is possible if there is strong divergent selection driving sympatric populations apart. When selection is sufficiently strong, it can overcome the homogenizing effects of gene flow, leading to significant population differentiation (Figure @ref(fig:msdspec)). Hence, speciation becomes a mere consequence of adaptation to different environmental conditions. Speciation with gene flow in response to divergent selection is also known as ecological speciation.\nIt is important to note that ecological speciation does not only happen in sympatry, but also in allopatry and other geographical contexts (peri- and parapatry). Hence, the geographic context is less of a focus in ecological speciation research. Rather, research primarily focuses on how exactly adaptation in response to divergent selection translates to reproductive isolation between incipient species.\n\n\n\n\n\nDivergence between populations connected by gene flow is a reflection of the balance between divergent selection and the rate of migration. As selection gets stronger, the homogenizing effect of migration gets smaller. Each simulation conists of two populations (represented in red and blue) that are connected by migration at the rate of 0.05 per generation. However, similations differ in the strength of divergent selection. A. wmigrants=0.95, whybrids=0.975; B. wmigrants=0.8, whybrids=0.9; C. wmigrants=0.6, whybrids=0.8; D. wmigrants=0.25, whybrids=0.5.\n\n\n\n\n\nReproductive Isolation as a Byproduct of Adaptation\nA wide variety of divergent sources of selection have been identified as driving forces in ecological speciation. For example, divergent selection can be caused by environmental differences in habitat structure, climate, or resource availability, as well as different communities of competitors, predators, or parasites. In addition, divergent selection may be driven by sexual selection, particularly when environmental variation causes selection on secondary sexual traits or on sensory systems.\nReproductive isolation during ecological speciation evolves incidentally, as a byproduct of adaption caused by divergent selection. Adaptation to different environmental conditions simply reduces the likelihood that individuals from diverging populations meet, that they recognize each other as potential mates if they do meet, that they are compatible during mating if they attempt to, and that they produce competitive hybrid offspring if eggs get fertilized. With the exception of gametic isolation, ecological speciation has been associated with every possible mechanism of reproductive isolation described above.\nA classic example of ecological speciation stems from mosquitofish (Gambusia hubbsi) that inhabit blue holes on the Bahamas islands. Blue holes are water-filled sinkholes that were created when underground caverns collapsed. Some of the Bahamas islands are dotted with isolated blue holes (Figure @ref(fig:bahagamb)A), and most have been colonized by mosquitofish. These blue holes, however, differ in whether other fish species have also arrived. In some, the mosquitofish live by themselves; in others, they have to share their habitat with bigmouth sleepers (Gobiomorus dormitor), a large predatory fish. Mosquitofish in different blue holes have adapted to the local ecological conditions. In habitats without predators, mosquitofish have convergently evolved streamlined bodies that allow for energy efficient swimming, while those in habitats with predators have evolved bodies that allow for rapid acceleration during predator escape movements. How has adaptation to the different predation regimes impacted the emergence of reproductive isolation? Brian Langerhans and colleagues (2007) conducted mate choice experiments with mosquitofish from different ecological settings. They first quantified the strength of female preference for a male of their own population, as opposed to a male from a different blue hole with the same predator regime, or a male from a different blue hole with the opposite predator regime. The results indicated that assortative mating (i.e., a preference for the male from the female’s own population) was much stronger when females were confronted with a foreign male derived from different environmental conditions (Figure @ref(fig:bahagamb)B). So, females from no-predation habitats preferred to mate with males from no-predation habitats, while those from blue holes with bigmouth sleeper preferred to mate with males from other high-predation habitats. Females made mating decisions based on male traits that are directly related to adaptation to different predation environments, as evidenced by the negative correlation between morphological dissimilarity and the relative strength in mating preference (Figure @ref(fig:bahagamb)C). In other words, females from both environments prefer to mate with males exhibiting a body shape that matches their specific ecological context. Adaptive evolution of a morphological trait consequently had inadvertent repercussions for mate choice, and ultimately caused behavioral isolation between diverging lineages.\n\n\nThe Role of Sexual Selection\nEven though ecological speciation is primarily driven by natural selection, sexual selection can also play a critical role in speciation processes. Specifically, ecological speciation can be facilitated when traits under divergent selection (i.e., traits involved in adaptation) also contribute to non-random mating (i.e., behavioral isolation). Such traits are often referred to as “magic traits”, because a single trait is associated with functions usually attributed to separate traits—those mediating adaptation and those mediating assortative mating.\nMagic traits appear to be a common theme in ecological speciation, as many adaptive modifications are also reliable cues for mating decisions. One of my favorite examples comes again from Darwin’s finches, where adaptive evolution of beak size has inadvertently affected the sounds males can produce when singing (Podos 2001). Adaptation to different food resources caused the diversification of beak sizes in finches from the genera Camarhynchus and Geospiza; species with smaller beaks tend to forage insects and other soft prey items, while those with larger beaks primarily feed on seeds. Changes in beak size have also impacted the vocal range individuals can produce. Birds with larger beaks have evolved songs with lower rates of syllable repetition and narrower frequency bandwidths, which ultimately reduces song complexity (Figure @ref(fig:beaksound)). Adaptation to different food resources was thus inadvertently correlated with the vocal communication essential in songbird mate recognition and courtship, facilitating the emergence of reproductive isolation in conjunction with adaptive trait evolution.\n\n\n\n\n\nBeak size evolution in Darwin’s finches in correlated with song complexity, as measured by vocal deviation. Higher vocal deviation in this case corresponds to lower song complexity. Data from Podos (2001).\n\n\n\n\nMagic traits can also arise from selection on sensory systems that impact mating decisions, not just mating signals themselves. For example, cichlids in Lake Victoria have adapted their eye physiology to optimize visual perception at the different depths where they live (Seehausen et al. 2008). Since ambient light becomes more red-shifted at greater depths, cichlids have evolved retinal pigments that are more apt to detect red light. As a consequence of chooser biases (Chapter 10), the changes in visual physiology are correlated with red shift in male nuptial coloration, such that adaptation to different light regimes has caused speciation between a population with blue nuptial coloration inhabiting shallow waters and a population with red nuptial coloration inhabiting deeper waters. Interestingly, speciation into blue and red forms has independently occurred multiple times within the lake.",

    "text": "16.5 Adaptive Radiation\nAdaptation and speciation are intimately linked processes; hence, the same evolutionary forces that cause organismal adaptation also drive the evolution of biodiversity. In some instances, adaptation to novel niches and speciation occur rapidly and at large scales, causing a single ancestor to diversify into a large number of derived species with unique ecological adaptations. This process is known as adaptive radiation. According to Schluter (2000), four criteria must be fulfilled to confirm an adaptive radiation: (1) Common ancestry: All species in an adaptive radiation must be derived from a recent common ancestor. (2) Phenotype-environment correlation: There should be an association between the niches organisms occupy and the phenotypic traits used to exploit those niches. (3) Trait utility: Traits that are correlated with niches need to provide a fitness advantage to their carriers in their specific niche. (4) Rapid speciation: There needs to be a burst of speciation that coincides with the ecological and phenotypic diversification of a group.\nAdaptive radiations are triggered when there is a wealth of ecological opportunity (open niches) that cannot be readily colonized by species already occupying those niches elsewhere. For example, adaptive radiations often occur in isolated lakes and on oceanic islands, where individuals of a single or a few colonizing species settle into niches that are occupied by a wealth of other species elsewhere. Similarly, adaptive radiations are evident in the fossil record after mass extinction events, where surviving species capitalized on open niches that were previously occupied. For example, mammals were able to diversity into novel niches that were freed up with the dinosaur extinction at the KT-boundary. Ecological opportunities may also arise through the evolution of novel traits (so-called key innovations) that allow organisms to enter novel adaptive zones that are yet unoccupied. The evolution of flight in birds and the evolution of endothermy in birds and mammals are key innovations that have allowed these taxa to invade new niches that were previously unavailable to ectotherms.\nEvidence for adaptive radiations comes from a diversity of taxa. Among the best-known are Darwin’s finches, which adapted to different food resources on the Galapagos islands, honeycreepers (Fringillidae), fruitflies (Drosophila), and silverswords (Argyroxiphium) have radiated to exploit different niches on the Hawai’ian archipelago, and Anolis lizard exhibit parallel adaptive radiations on different Caribbean islands. The most stunning adaptive radiations, however, are found in African lakes, where cichlid fishes (family Cichlidae) have diversified into hundreds of species with unique adaptations. The largest adaptive radiations are found in Lake Victoria (&gt;500 species in as little as 14,000 years), Lake Tanganyika (about 200 species in 9-12 million years), and Lake Malawi (about 1,000 species in 3.4 million years). These are phenomenal numbers for single lakes, especially considering that there are more species of cichlids in African lakes than there are fish species in North America. How is it possible that so many species have evolved in such little time?\n\n16.5.1 African Cichlid Fishes\nTo learn more about the process of adaptive radiation, we will take a closer look at the adaptive radiations of cichlids in Lakes Victoria, Tanganyika, and Malawi. All of these lakes are huge; 3 of the top-10 largest lakes in the world. They are so big, in fact, that Livingston—on his expedition to cross the African continent—thought that he reached the Indian Ocean when he encountered Lake Malawi in 1859; imagine the disappointment when he first tasted the lake’s freshwater. Lake Victoria is very shallow, very young (400,000 years, although the lake was completely dry as recently as 14,000 years ago), and primarily located in Uganda and Tanzania. Lake Tanganyika and Lake Malawi are located further south and are associated with the African Rift, a tectonic spreading zone that divides the continent. Both lakes are much older than Lake Victoria and very deep (100 m for Lake Tanganyika, 770 m for Lake Malawi), although lake levels have fluctuated massively through time.\nConsidering the size of the lakes, it is not surprising that they offer a diversity of niches. When the lakes were colonized by cichlids, diversification primarily occurred along three ecological axes: (1) Macrohabitat use: The initial diversification in each lake likely occurred as species adapted to different macrohabitats. Some examples of macrohabitats include sandy beaches, rocky reefs, and open and deep water. (2) Trophic resource use: Within macrohabitats, species diverged in the food resources they exploit. Modifications to jaws and dentition have allowed different species to specialize on very specific diets: there are different types of piscivores (fish-eating predators), zooplankton feeders, molluscivores that can crush the shells of snails, crevice feeders with specialized jaws, algae eaters that either gather their food or scrape it off rocks, scale-eaters that pick scales off of other fish, fin biters, ectoparasite cleaners, and so-called paedophages that specialize on eating eggs and developing young that many cichlid females incubate in their mouths. (3) Communication: Species with similar habitat use and trophic specialization often diverge in communication, with stark divergence in male nuptial coloration and matching female preferences. The divergence along multiple niche axes allows even ecologically similar species to coexist. In general, there are four key factors that have contributed to the massive and repeated radiations of cichlid fishes.\n\nEcological Opportunity and Key Innovation\nComparative analyses beyond the three lakes we have discussed so far provided evidence for the role of ecological opportunity in adaptive radiation. Other African lakes also harbor adaptive radiations of cichlid fishes, although they are not quite as large—and often substantially smaller—than the radiations seen in Lakes Victoria, Tanganyika, and Malawi. Comparing lake size with the number of species in each adaptive radiation clearly indicates that larger lakes—which presumably have more ecological niches—also harbor a larger number of species (Figure @ref(fig:lakesize)). Hence, the sheer number of species in the Great African lakes is in part a consequence of their size.\nStill, you might ask, why is it always cichlid fishes that have radiated in African lakes? A key innovation of cichlid fishes, which is hypothesized to have facilitated adaptation to different trophic niches, is the complexity of their jaws and the decoupling of oral and pharyngeal jaws. Cichlid do not have only one set of jaws visible from the outside (the oral jaws), but also a second internal set of jaws located at the back of the throat (pharyngeal jaws). Oral jaws are used for prey acquisition, while pharyngeal jaws are used for prey processing (e.g., shedding for plant matter or crushing of snails). The increased modularity of the jaw apparatus and the decoupling of different functions is thought to have lifted constraints in jaw evolution, making it possible for cichlids to modify their jaws in wide variety of ways and adapt to different food resources.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe relationship of lake size and species number in different adaptive radiations of cichlid fishes. Data from Seehausen (2006).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHybridization\nHybridization can be a powerful motor for generating functional diversity early during a radiation. Research, especially on Lake Victoria and Malawi cichlids, has indicated that these lakes were likely colonized by one or a few closely related forms that adapted to different ecological niches. Upon initial diversification, hybridization between species then suddenly created a wealth of new phenotypes. In an environment with a lot of open niches, intermediate phenotypes that arise from hybridization may be well-adapted to exploit a resource that is underused. Furthermore, hybridization can also create novel phenotypes that are outside the range of both parental species, a phenomenon called transgressive segregation. Transgressive segregation is caused by the recombination of genes with non-additive genetic effects, and the resulting novel phenotypes may be able to exploit resources that are inaccessible to the parental forms.\nHybridization can consequently lead to a burst of functional diversification. As long as open niches are available, there may be little or no cost to hybridization, because competition is low. However, as niches fill up and competition intensifies, the situation changes, and with increasing costs of hybridization, reinforcement should facilitate the evolution of reproductive barriers that reduce interspecific matings. Over time, competitive exclusion leads to the disappearance of suboptimal forms that cannot compete with others. As a consequence, species diversity does not continuously increase with the age of an adaptive radiation. Rather, species diversity is highest in relatively young adaptive radiations, where novel forms are generated rapidly through hybridization, and before selection eliminates forms that do not fall within a unique niche. The non-constant rate of speciation explains why some young adaptive radiations (like Lake Victoria) have a lot more species than older adaptive radiations (Lake Tanganyika).\n\n\nMicroallopatry and Lake Level Fluctuations\nLakes are contiguous bodies of water, and as such they seem free of any geographic barriers. Even a small fish should, in theory, be able to swim anywhere it pleases. So, at first sight, speciation within each lake seems to be happening largely in sympatry. In practice, however, fish do not just swim anywhere they please, but have fairly strict habitat associations. For example, cichlid species that are associated with rocky reef habitats are philopatric, and even short stretches of sand between rocky reefs represent a significant physical barrier that these fish do not regularly cross (a phenomenon called microallopatry). Hence, these large lakes should not be viewed as contiguous, but as composed of distinct and physically isolated habitat patches. In many ways, the rocky reefs act like isolated islands in a sea of sand. Consequently, allopatric speciation processes can also contribute to species diversification.\nBesides microallopatry, lake level fluctuations can impact speciation processes. Lake Tanganyika, for example, became subdivided into multiple distinct lakes when water levels fell in the past. Divergence in allopatry and completion of the speciation process upon secondary contact explains divergence patterns in multiple groups of cichlids. In addition, lake level fluctuations can drastically change the availability of different habitat types. Imagine a population of cichlids that occupies a rocky shore when the lake level is low (Figure @ref(fig:speciespump)A). As lake levels rise, some individuals of that species might be able to colonize new rocky reef habitats in shallower water (Figure @ref(fig:speciespump)B). Over time, the populations diverge in allopatry, for example, due to adaptation to local environmental conditions (Figure @ref(fig:speciespump)C). As lake levels drop and habitats in shallow areas of the lake disappear, species have to retreat to suitable habitats in deeper waters, bringing the divergent lineages into secondary contact (Figure @ref(fig:speciespump)D). In sympatry, competitive exclusion may cause some lineages to disappear, or reinforcement could strengthen reproductive isolation and push the speciation process forward. If lake levels rise again, the newly formed species once again disperse to novel habitats in shallow water (Figure @ref(fig:speciespump)E), where they diverge in isolation (Figure @ref(fig:speciespump)F). As the process repeats itself, more and more species are generated until all niches are occupied by corresponding specialists. This process is called a “species-pump” and illustrates how changes in environmental conditions, in conjunction with local adaptation, can generate species diversity on small spatial scales. Some rocky reefs in Lake Malawi, which harbor unique microendemics found nowhere else in the lake, were dry just over 100 years ago when lake levels were significantly lower than today—suggesting that processes associated with species pumps are ongoing today and rapid.\n\n\n\n\n\nLake level fluctuations can drive speciation if they cause the repeated splitting and fusion of species (see text for details. Dark blue areas indicate deep areas of the lake, light blue areas shallow areas. Rocky reefs are shown in brown, and the colored circle represent different species as they move between habitats\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSexual Selection\nLast but not least, sexual selection has played an important role in the diversification of cichlid fishes. Sexual selection is generally strong in most cichlids from Africa’s Rift lakes, since females incubate their offspring in their mouths for extended periods of time, and males court in leks without contributing to reproduction beyond the provisioning of sperm. The effect of strong sexual selection is evidenced by the wealth of species that appear to be morphologically and ecologically similar, but exhibit differences in the coloration of courting males. Even subtle differences in coloration are associated with strong patterns of assortative mating. For example, in the Maylandia zebra species complex of Lake Malawi, some sympatric species differ only in the extent of blue vs. orange coloration in the dorsal fin (Blais et al. 2009). Females detect these subtle differences and have clear mating preferences for their own male type (Figure @ref(fig:cassmat)). More so, even allopatric forms that look nearly indistinguishable to the human eye will mate assortatively under laboratory conditions (Figure @ref(fig:cassmat)). This suggests that strong divergence in female preferences and male nuptial coloration, even between closely related species and populations, represent strong reproductive barriers keeping species apart.\n\n\n\n\n\nMating trials with cichlids of the genus Maylandia indicated that both sympatric species with different color patterns and allopatric species with similar color patterns are reproductively isolated through female mate choice.

    "text": "16.7 Practical Skills: Interpreting Structure Plots\nFrom a coding perspective, there are no new graph types you need to learn about for this exercise; you will be able to apply skills that you have already learned over the past chapters. However, you will have a chance to explore some population genetic data that are commonly used to investigate ongoing speciation with gene flow. Specifically, analyses of population structure use genetic data from multiple loci to test hypotheses about the most likely number of genetically distinct clusters in a set of samples. These analyses try to identify the systematic differences in allele frequencies that arise between subpopulations as a consequence of nonrandom mating. Results from analyses of population structure are typically visualized using stacked bar plots, where each bar corresponds to an individual, and bar segments are proportional to the probability of an individual belonging to a particular cluster (this is equivalent to the proportion of an individual’s genetic ancestry from one of the clusters). Sounds abstract? Let’s look at some concrete scenarios.\nSuppose we found this really cool species of bird that looks slightly different across two habitats, and we wanted to know whether the birds in the different habitats constitute different populations with reduced gene flow between them (i.e., we want to know whether there is population structure or not). So we go out, sample 20 birds from each habitat, sequence some genes, and we calculate the probability of each individual belonging to either of two hypothesized subgroups based on allele frequency differences. If there is no population differentiation, and all birds across both habitats represent one randomly mating population, the probability for each individual belonging to either one of the two clusters is 50 %—that is no better than chance! This is illustrated in Figure @ref(fig:admixture)A: statistically, we cannot tell apart individuals from the two habitat types based on their genetic makeup.\nAt the other end of the extreme, we might find very strong population structure, with two randomly mating populations but no interbreeding between them. In that case, we may be able to assign each individual to one of two clusters with 100 % probability. This scenario is illustrated in Figure @ref(fig:admixture)B; individuals from each habitat are distinct and clearly assignable to one of two clusters based on their multilocus genotype.\nIn many cases, the actual results are somewhere in between (Figure @ref(fig:admixture)C). In this case, there is significant population genetic differentiation, but there are also some individuals where the assignment probabilities are somewhere between 0 and 100 %. Such individuals provide evidence for recent gene flow between clusters through interbreeding. For example, individuals with an assignment probability of 50 % in this scenario are putative F1 hybrids between individuals from the two populations.\n\n\n\n\n\nA. Hypothetical structure plot with no genetic differentiation between populations. The assignment probability for each individual to either cluster 1 or cluster 2 is 50%, which is equal to random chance. B. Hypothetical structure plot with strong genetic differentiation between populations. The assignment probability for each individual to one of the two clusters is 100%, meaning that the individuals from each populations are genetically distinct. C. Hypothetical structure plot with strong genetic differentiation and evidence for admixture between the clusters. Individuals with intermediate assignment probabilities provide evidence for recent interbreeding between the clusters.\n\n\n\n\nIt’s important to note that structure analyses may reveal more clusters than just two (Figure @ref(fig:admixture2)). The number of clusters in a given sample also does not have to be determined a priori. Rather, analyses of genetic structure are run for different numbers of clusters, and the actual number of cluster can then be determined empirically.\n\n\n\n\n\nHypothetical structure plot with three clusters and evidence for some genetic differentiation.",

    "text": "18 Evolution of DNA Sequences\nSo far, we have explored evolutionary principles primarily through classical genetics. We have abstracted DNA sequence variation as alleles at loci, which is a powerful approach for studying evolution. DNA, however, is famously composed of four letter-coded nucleotides—A (adenine), T (thymine), G (guanine), and C (cytosine)—and we can learn a great deal by studying DNA sequences directly.\nAt the advent of molecular genetics, DNA sequence variation had to be inferred indirectly by studying variation in proteins. Evolutionary biologists relied on allozymes—variant forms of an enzyme derived from different alleles—which exhibit differences in their structure. Allozymes for a particular locus can be detected using gel electrophoresis, because different structural variants move through an electric field at different speeds and thus separate on a gel (Figure @ref(fig:allozyme)). Because not all mutations necessarily lead to detectable structural changes at the protein level, much genetic variation was lost in translation by focusing on proteins. Even so, the analyses of allozymes revealed an extraordinary amount of genetic variation; much more, in fact, than anticipated by theoreticians.\nExample of a gel used to separate different allozymes encoded by the same locus. Each column represents an indidivudal sample. Bands that align horizontally correspond to the same allozyme (allele), and this particular locus exhibits four distinct allozymes. Note that heterozygous individuals exhibit two bands (samples 1-3, 7, 9, and 14).\nWe have been able to quantify genetic variation directly for several decades, first through restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) and Sanger sequencing—which were relatively slow—and now through a variety of next-generation, high-throughput sequencing methods that allow the sequencing of whole genomes in a matter of hours. In this chapter, we will focus on what we can uncover about historical processes through analyzing organisms’ DNA. We will also explore the molecular signatures of evolution, what they reveal about the different forces shaping DNA sequence changes across generations, and the culprits behind the large amount of genetic variation present in natural populations.",

    "text": "18.1 DNA Alignment and Genome Assembly\nThe output of any DNA-sequencing method is the actual order of As, Ts, Gs, and Cs of the DNA in a particular sample. Some sequencing methods, like Sanger sequencing, target very specific regions of the genome (typically a gene of interest). Resulting sequences can then be directly aligned for analysis. Sequence alignment arranges DNA fragments by similarity, matching up homologous nucleotides across samples. Aligned sequences are arranged in a matrix, where sequences from different samples are organized in rows and homologous nucleotides in columns (Figure @ref(fig:alignment)). Once aligned, DNA sequences can be used to quantify similarities among different samples, or to identify single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs; Chapter 4) that underlie many population genetic analyses.\n\n\n\n\n\nAn example of a nucleotide alignment, where sequences from different samples are organized in rows and homologous nucleotides are organized in columns. Visual inspection of the alignment reveals regions that are relatively conserved across samples (e.g., positions 18-25) as well as highly variable regions (e.g., poistions 42-50).\n\n\n\n\nMany next-generation sequencing methods operate differently from Sanger sequencing in that they yield relatively short reads (a few hundred base pairs) from random segments of the genome. Millions—even billions—of reads are generated in every sequencing run. But before any meaningful comparisons can be made across samples, individual reads need to be aligned and merged to reconstruct the original DNA sequence. To do so, reads can be aligned to a known reference sequence (e.g., an assembled reference genome) that facilitates the identification of homologous sequences (Figure @ref(fig:assembly)). In absence of a reference and provided enough reads are available, overlap between individual reads can also be used to infer the original sequence, just like the contour of puzzle pieces provide clues for what pieces fit together. Once individual fragments are aligned, the consensus sequence across all reads can be inferred for a given sample, and sequences of different samples can then be aligned as described above.\n\n\n\n\n\nMost next-generation sequencing methods yield many short fragments of DNA sequences that were randomly amplified throughout the genome. To reconstruct the full DNA sequence, fragments can be mapped to a known reference sequence. If a reference is not available, overlap between individual fragments can be used to infer the DNA sequence of larger segments of the genome.\n\n\n\n\nAligned DNA sequences form the base of many analyses used to infer evolutionary patterns and processes. Within species, we can use this information to quantify the degree of population differentiation, migration rates among populations, and even the demographic history of populations. Between species, we can reconstruct historical patterns of speciation and diversification as visualized by phylogenetic trees. DNA sequences also hold clues as to the role of selection and genetic drift in evolutionary change.",

    "section": "18.2 The Neutral Theory",
    "text": "18.2 The Neutral Theory\nDNA sequences not only allow us to reconstruct the phylogenetic history of life, but they also allow us to make inferences about how selection and genetic drift have shaped the evolution of genomes. Selection has clearly shaped the evolution of phenotypic traits, mediating organismal adaptation to diverse environmental conditions. But as we learned in Chapter 4, many mutations have no or a negligible impact on the expression of phenotypes, and accordingly, on individual fitness. It was Motoo Kimura, a Japanese population geneticist famous for his innovative use of mathematics to advance evolutionary theory, who first proposed that evolution at a molecular level is primarily governed by genetic drift—not by natural selection. While selection eliminates deleterious alleles, Kimura established that neutral mutations are fixed at a constant rate (1/2Ne) due to chance (Chapter 6). Accordingly, different species are predicted to accumulate their own sets of neutral mutations over time, and the number of mutations between two species should be proportional to the time of divergence between them.\nComparing two methods for estimating divergence time, Charles Langley and Walter Fitch put this idea to the test in 1974 by quantifying the number of nucleotide substitutions in the cytochrome c gene between different species of mammals and estimating their divergence time based on the fossil record. As predicted by Kimura’s neutral theory, there is a clear correlation between the divergence time of two species and the number of substitutions in their cytochrome c gene (Figure @ref(fig:molc)). Theory and empirical evidence consequently suggest that neutral mutations accumulate in genomes in a clock-like fashion, although the rate at which mutations accumulate varies among genomic regions. The molecular rate of evolution is highest in pseudogenes and other non-functional genomic regions, because every possible mutation is selectively neutral. The rate of molecular evolution is slowest at non-synonymous sites, because many mutations have fitness consequences and thus behave non-neutrally.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe number of substitutions in the cytochrome c gene for different species pairs as a function of their divergence time. Data from Langley and Fitch (1974).\n\n\n\n\n\n18.2.1 Molecular Clocks\nBecause mutations accumulate at roughly constant rates, we can infer the timing of evolutionary events by quantifying the number of nucleotide substitutions. This approach to dating evolutionary events is also know as the “molecular clock”. Before applying a molecular clock in practice, fixation rates must be aligned to actual time (in generations or years) and account for potential effects of population size, which determines the likelihood of fixation for a neutral allele (1/2N). Regions of the genome with slow substitution rates are typically used to date events in deep time and calibrated by linking patterns of nucleotide substitutions to evolutionary events observed in the fossil record. This is particularly useful to time branching points in phylogenetic hypotheses, leading to time-calibrated phylogenetic trees. In contrast, regions of the genome with rapid substitution rates are used to estimate the timing of more recent evolutionary events. In some instances, fast molecular clocks can be calibrated based on repeated sampling of genotypes within a population.\nAn example of molecular clock application is the investigation into the evolutionary origins of HIV (human immunodeficiency virus). AIDS—the disease associated with an HIV infection—was first described in a clinical setting in the early 1980s and then spread rapidly through the human populations, at first regionally (e.g., portions of Africa, Haiti, and New York) and soon worldwide. Early evolutionary studies showed that HIV arose as a zoonotic disease, when SIV (simian immunodeficiency virus) was transmitted from chimpanzees to humans in western Africa, likely as a consequence of bushmeat consumption. However, the timing of the zoonotic transmission was unclear. Was this a disease that had been circulating in human populations unrecognized for some time, or was it a recent transmission across species boundaries? To get at this question, Korber et al. (2000) sequenced a large number of HIV samples that were collected between 1983 and 1997. They estimated the rate of HIV evolution based on sequence variation in their samples and the age of the virus isolates. Extrapolating that evolutionary rate indicated that the common ancestor of HIV strains present in their sample likely dated back to the 1930s (Figure @ref(fig:hiv)) and had been transmitted within the human population for several decades. The subsequent discovery of HIV in a tissue sample collected from the Democratic Republic of Congo in 1959 allowed for an independent test of that molecular clock. Analyzing the DNA sequence of the new isolate and plotting it along the other data indicated a genetic similarity consistent with the inferred molecular clock (Rambaut et al. 2004); in fact, the historical sample landed almost perfectly on the extrapolation line (red sample in Figure @ref(fig:hiv)).\n\n\n\n\n\nThe application of a molecular clock used to date the orgin of HIV-1 group M (the principal pandemic group). Based on DNA sequence variation in isolates collected between 1983 and 1997, the shared common ancestor of HIV likely existed in the 1930s. The red dot represents the earliest known HIV sample, which corroborates the molecular clock estimate. Data from Korber et al. (2000).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n18.2.2 Detecting Signatures of Selection\nThe neutral theory also provides a powerful null model to test for historical signatures of selection in the genome. If neutral alleles become fixed in a population at regular rates, deviations from that rate must indicate non-neutrality (i.e., selection). One way to detect selection is to analyze the rate of non-synonymous (dN) to synonymous (dS) substitutions in the genome. This ratio is also known as ⍵=dN/dS. If you imagine a pseudogene, the likelihood that a non-synonymous mutation is fixed is equal to the likelihood that a synonymous substitution gets fixed, because—in a pseudogene—both types of mutations are selectively neutral. Hence, under strict neutrality, the ratio between dN and dS is 1. In most protein-coding genes, non-synonymous mutations can impact the structure and function of the translated protein, and these functional changes can come with fitness benefits or costs. If the non-synonymous substitution provides a fitness benefit, selection causes the mutation to spread and become fixed in a population at a higher rate than expected by chance alone (also see Figure 6.5). Thus, dN will be higher than dS, such that the ratio between the two rates is greater than 1. In contrast, if a non-synonymous substitution imposes a fitness cost, selection eliminates the mutation from a population, drastically reducing the likelihood of fixation (Figure 6.5). In this case, the ratio between dN and dS is smaller than 1.\nIn practice, we can analyze rates of nucleotide substitution in individual protein-coding genes across the branches of a phylogeny. If the rate of dN/dS is around 1, the analyzed gene evolved neutrally (Figure @ref(fig:dnds)A). If dN/dS is &gt;1, the gene was under positive (or divergent) selection, which means new variants were brought to high frequency by natural selection (Figure @ref(fig:dnds)B). Genes under positive selection likely play an important role in adaptation. In contrast, if dN/dS is &lt;1, the gene was under negative (or purifying) selection (Figure @ref(fig:dnds)C). This represents the selective removal of deleterious alleles and can lead to conserved regions of the genome.\n\n\n\n\n\nNeutral (gray) and non-neutral (different shades of color) mutations plotted on hypothetical phylogenies. A. Under the assumptions of the neutral theory, the rate of non-synonymous to synonynous substitutions should be equal (dN/dS=1). B. If a locus is under positive (or divergent) selection, non-synonymous mutations are expected to be driven to fixation rapidly, leading to an underrepresentation of synonymous mutations (dN/dS&gt;1). C. If a locus is under negative (or purifying) selection, non-synonymous mutations are expected to be eliminated rapidly, leading to an overrepresentation of synonymous mutations (dN/dS&lt;1).",

    "text": "18.3 Case Study: SARS-CoV-2\nThis chapter’s case study explores the application of phylogenetics and molecular evolution through the lens of SARS-CoV-2, the coronavirus behind the current COVID-19 pandemic. First, you will plot a phylogeny of coronaviruses to address questions about the evolutionary history of the virus, then you will establish a molecular clock for the virus, and finally, you will explore the distribution of genetic variation throughout the coronavirus genome to make inferences about the potential forces shaping molecular evolution. Before diving into the problems, I want to provide you with some background on host-pathogen evolution using the flu (influenza A) as an example.\n\n18.3.1 Host-Pathogen Coevolution\nIn 1858, French chemist Louis Pasteur was the first to recognize that contagious diseases are caused by pathogens—just a year prior to Darwin’s publication of The Origin of Species. Pathogens, of course, represent evolvable populations that are shaped by evolutionary forces, just like all other living things. Central to understanding pathogen evolution is recognizing the conflict between pathogens and their hosts, which have diametrically opposed interests. Pathogens want to overcome a host’s defense mechanisms and use its body to self-replicate and then jump to other hosts. In contrast, hosts want to avoid incurring fitness costs associated with the energetic demands of pathogens and other damage they can inflict. Hence, hosts are selected to evolve strategies that exclude and combat pathogens, while pathogens are selected to evade the hosts’ defense mechanisms.\nThis evolutionary tit-for-tat is known as coevolution, where the adaptation of each actor (e.g., a new defense strategy in a host) exerts selection on the other actor (the pathogen that now needs to overcome the new line of defense). Coevolution leads to continuous cycles of adaptation and counteradaptation, and the coevolutionary relationship between hosts and pathogens has been likened to a coevolutionary arms race. Since pathogens typically have large populations, short generation times, and high mutation rates compared to their hosts, they generally have the upper hand and lead the arms race.\n\nDefinition: Coevolution\nCoevolution is the process of reciprocal evolutionary change that occurs between interacting species.\n\nThe acquired immune system of vertebrates is one of the most exquisite adaptations to pathogens. It allows hosts to recognize foreign intruders to the body and generate antibodies that act specifically to combat the intruder, using both humoral and cell-mediated responses. These specific responses also create immunological memory, which leads to an enhanced response and even immunity during secondary infections of the same pathogen or pathogen strain. Hence, immune hosts are not suitable for pathogens, unless pathogens have evolved sufficiently that the host immune system does not recognize them anymore.\n\n\n18.3.2 The Evolution of the Seasonal Flu\nInfluenza A and B cause the seasonal flu in humans. The influenza A genome consists of 8 RNA strands that encode for 11 proteins. One protein of particular evolutionary interest is hemagglutinin. Hemagglutinin is expressed at the surface of the virus and involved in the initiation of an infection of a new host cell. Some parts of the protein—the antigenic sites—also represent the primary target sites that the host immune system responds to. Thus, hemagglutinin is critical for the interaction between host and pathogen. To persist in a population, influenza A needs to find a naive host whose immune system has never been exposed to the virus and therefore cannot recognize its antigenic sites. Alternatively, the virus needs to exhibit mutations at antigenic sites that are sufficiently different from the antigenic sites of previous infections to overcome the host’s immunity. This raises interesting questions about the evolution of the hemagglutinin gene through time.\nThe sequencing of influenza A strains over almost 20 years revealed a steady accumulation of nucleotide substitutions in the hemagglutinin gene (Figure @ref(fig:flu)). Older strains of the flu consistently disappear, while new strains emerge through mutation and spread. Over time, this leads to flu variants that are substantially different from the original sample. This finding is consistent with the neutral theory; mutations are accumulating through time in a clock-wise fashion. The question is, however, what allowed the persisting strains to endure when others went extinct? It turns out that persisting lineages exhibit a disproportionate amount of mutations at antigenic sites compared to the most prevalent strains present at any given time. In other words, rare strains that are most dissimilar at sites recognized by the host immune system are the most successful at infecting new hosts and spreading in a population. Until, of course, they become common, and another dissimilar variant starts to have the same selective advantage (this is negative frequency-dependent selection in action). The consequence is that the accumulation of mutations is not equal throughout the gene, and there is clear evidence for positive selection on 18 codons that all lie within the antigenic sites of hemagglutinin. So while nucleotide substitutions accumulate steadily through time, non-synonymous substitution accumulate disproportionately (i.e., ⍵&gt;1) where is really matters: the attack sites of the host immune system. These results show how the host immune system can drive pathogen evolution, and these general evolutionary principles are used to predict the dominant variants of the seasonal flu every year, which is used to produce flu vaccines well before flu season actually starts.\n\n\n\n\n\nAccumulation of nucleotide substitutions in the hemagglutinin gene of the influenza A virus from 1968-1987. This time period is equivalent to about 20 million years of mammalian evolution. Data from Fitch et al. (1991).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n18.3.3 High-Virulence Flu Strains\nBesides the seasonal flu, which ravages across the planet in annual cycles, there are also high-virulence flu strains that emerge periodically. High-virulence flu strains induce high mortality and—in some instances— have spread rapidly in human populations, causing pandemics. Among the most well-known high-virulence flu strains were the Spanish flu (1918 influenza pandemic) and the 2009 swine flu, which were both caused by the H1N1 influenza A virus. In addition, smaller high-virulence flu outbreaks associated with bird and swine flus have been documented repeatedly over the past decades. High-virulence flu strains can induce high mortality because they have vastly different antigenic sites compared to the seasonal flu, making it much harder for our immune system to recognize and combat the virus.\nWhere do these radically different antigenic sites come from? Humans are not the only organisms that can contract the influenza A viruses; they also infect other vertebrates (especially other mammals and birds). Due to long coevolutionary histories, different host groups exhibit different flu strains, with reciprocal adaptations in the hosts and pathogens. However, cross-infections can occur, especially when humans work in close contact with animals (e.g., on pig or poultry farms). In most instances, cases of cross-infection are evolutionary dead ends because the viruses—poorly adapted to the novel host—cannot be transmitted from human to human. However, if a cross-infection occurs in a host that is already infected with a human influenza A strain, genetic segments from the different strains can mix to produce a novel third strain. This process is called viral reassortment, and the resulting strain can inherit the capability to transmit from human to human, while simultaneously exhibiting drastically different surface proteins that cause severe courses of disease.",

    "text": "18.4 Practical Skills: Working with Phylogenetic Trees\nThe exercise associated with this chapter will primarily focus on visualizing phylogenetic trees and associated metadata and interpreting data from molecular evolution analyses. To do so, you will use some new R functions from packages you have not previously used. Note that you will not have to write the more complex code associated with this exercise from scratch; some information in this section just provides additional context if you want to dig deeper.\n\n18.4.1 Installing Dependencies\nTo work through this week’s exercise, you will need to install four new R packages. Three of these packages (ape, dplyr, phytools, and tidyr) are available through CRAN (the network providing R) and can be installed the same way as previous packages (i.e., use the install.packages() function or click Tools&gt;Install Packages…).\ninstall.packages(\"ape\")\ninstall.packages(\"dplyr\")\ninstall.packages(\"phytools\")\ninstall.packages(\"tidyr\")\nThe fourth package (ggtree) is not available from CRAN and needs to be retrieved from a different repository, called Bioconductor. Bioconductor is specialized in providing tools for the analysis of a wide variety of high-throughput biological data (including phylogenetics, genomics, and transcriptomics). To install packages from Bioconductor, you first need to install an auxiliary package (BiocManager). Once installed, Bioconductor packages can be installed using the BiocManager::install() function. So, to install ggtree, you will have to execute the following code.\ninstall.packages(\"BiocManager\")\nBiocManager::install(\"ggtree\")\nAfter installation, make sure to either delete the installation code or silence the code with hashtags to avoid problems with knitting the document to an *.html file.\n\n Important Note\nIf you are having trouble installing ggtree, please make sure that your computer fulfills the system requirements. Some Bioconductor packages are notorious for not playing well with Google Chromebooks, outdated versions of Mac OS, and some antivirus programs on PCs.\n\n\n\n18.4.2 The Pipe Operator\nIn this exercise, you will see the use of the so-called pipe operator, %&gt;%, which is part of the dplyr package. The pipe operator is used to pass the results of the function on the left hand side as an argument to the function on the right hand side. It allows us to skip the definition of intermediate variables and chain together multiple functions in a series. The pipe operator is widely used to simplify code, both in terms of readability and execution.\nTo give you a practical example: the way we have used R before, it takes four lines of code to define a vector (a), take its square-root (b), calculate the mean of the square-root transformed vector (c), and then display the result:\n\na &lt;- seq(0,10, by=1)\nb &lt;- sqrt(a)\nc &lt;- mean(b)\nprint(c)\n\n[1] 2.042571\n\n\nUsing the pipe operator, we can link together the four functions directly into a pipeline to obtain the same result:\n\nseq(0,10, by=1) %&gt;% sqrt() %&gt;% mean() %&gt;% print()\n\n[1] 2.042571\n\n\nYou are not required to use the pipe operator in your coding. However, some of the pre-written code in this week’s exercise makes use of this function.\n\n\n18.4.3 Importing a Tree\nPhylogenetic trees are encoded in a variety of file formats that can all be imported into R. We will be working with trees in the Newick format (*.nwk), which is commonly used in many phylogenetics applications. To import a *.nwk-file, you can use the read.tree() function from the ape package. The example used here is based on a sample tree you can download here (and yes… this is a phylogeny of all the fish species in my fish room🤓).\n\n#Import a phylogenetic tree in the Newick format\ntest.tree &lt;- phytools::read.newick(\"data/7_test_tree.nwk\")\n\nAs always when you import data into R, successfully executing this code should generate an object called “test.tree” in your work space (top right panel in RStudio).\n\n\n18.4.4 Plotting a Tree\nTo plot phylogenetic trees, we will use the ggtree() function of the ggtree package, because it is based on the ggplot2 functionalities that you are already familiar with. Note that other R packages (ape, phytools) also allow for the visualization of phylogenetic trees, although we will not be using those.\nTo plot a tree, you can simply execute the ggtree() function using the imported tree object as an argument. Note that a number of additional arguments allow for the modification of the base plot, which you can explore here if you are interested.\n\ntree &lt;- ggtree(test.tree)\ntree\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n18.4.5 Annotating a Tree\nThe structure of a tree alone is rarely sufficient to address evolutionary hypotheses; it is the annotation of trees with additional information that makes them useful.\n\nTip Labels\nTip labels can be added to a tree using the geom_tiplab() function. Note that depending on the length of labels, the canvas of the plot has to be adjusted with xlim().\n\ntree + \n  geom_tiplab() + #Add tip labels\n  xlim(NA,500) #Make some extra space so tip labels are not cut off\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWorking with Metadata\nMetadata is a set of data that gives additional information about other data. For phylogenies, metadata typically provides additional information about the taxa in a tree. Note that each metadataset needs to have a column called label, in which individual entries match the tip labels in the phylogenetic tree.\nThe metadata for the example tree used here can be imported using the read.csv() function that you are already familiar with. As you can see below, it provides information about the geographic distribution and dietary habits of each species in the phylogeny.\n\nmeta.data &lt;- read.csv(\"data/7_metadata.csv\")\nhead(meta.data)\n\n                          label         origin      diet\n1          Ancistrus_ranunculus  South America herbivore\n2 Carinotetraodon_travancoricus          India carnivore\n3      Chromobotia_macracanthus Southeast Asia  omnivore\n4              Corydoras_aeneus  South America  omnivore\n5               Corydoras_julii  South America  omnivore\n6            Corydoras_paleatus  South America  omnivore\n\n\nWe can now use a version of the pipe operator called left-join (%&lt;+%) to annotate the base tree generated above with information from the metadata. To do so, we add the base tree on the left side of the operator and the metadata with the additional geoms on the right side of the operator. For example, we can replace the original tip labels to display the dietary habit of each species instead:\n\ntree  %&lt;+% meta.data + geom_tiplab(aes(label=diet), offset=0) + ggtree::xlim(NA,500)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAlternatively, we can plot the original tip labels in addition to the dietary habits. In this case, the offset argument is required to make sure labels are not printed on to of each other:\n\ntree  %&lt;+% meta.data + geom_tiplab() + geom_tiplab(aes(label=diet), offset=240) + ggtree::xlim(NA,750)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFinally, we can also color code the tips of the phylogeny based on an input variable using geom_tippoint():\n\ntree  %&lt;+% meta.data + geom_tiplab(offset=20) + geom_tiplab(aes(label=diet), offset=370) + ggtree::xlim(NA,900) + geom_tippoint(aes(color=origin), na.rm = TRUE)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you are interested in learning more about phylogenetic tree annotation using ggtree, I recommend Part II in Guangchuang Yu’s book “Data Integration, Manipulation and Visualization of Phylogenetic Trees”.\n\n\n\n18.4.6 Calculating the Distance to Root\nTo establish a molecular clock for samples collected across a range of time, we need to enumerate the number of nucleotide substitutions for a given sample, relative to the common ancestor of all samples in the data set. Naturally, that common ancestor itself may not actually be in the data set; in fact, there is no expectation that it would be. However, phylogenetics allows us to side-step that problem, because phylogenies infer the pattern of shared ancestry across all samples in the data set, with the common ancestor of all samples representing the root of the tree. In a tree where branch lengths are proportional to the genetic similarity between nodes, we can consequently calculate the distance between the root and any given tip as a metric of genetic divergence. This can be accomplished by the distRoot() function from the adephylo package. Note that this function requires some significant computational time, especially for larger phylogenies. Rather than having you to run this in the exercise, we are simply providing you with the output of the distRoot() function that you can import as a *.csv file.",

    "text": "22 Human Evolution\nViewing the world through the eyes of an evolutionary biologist allows us to appreciate the origins of biodiversity and develop tangible solutions to some of the world’s major problems. But it also raises a number of questions about ourselves: How did humans come about? Why did we start to walk on two feet, use tools, and make art? And are we still evolving today? Darwin recognized how his ideas challenged the prevailing dogma that humans are somehow separate from the rest of God’s creation. Like other naturalists before him, he aptly observed our apparent relationship to other primates, and his ideas implied that the resemblance of traits between humans and other apes was a consequence of descent from a common ancestor. Hence, he concluded in The Origin of Species:\nConsidering how meticulously Darwin collected evidence in support of his hypotheses on descent with modification and natural selection, he offered surprisingly little insight about the implications of his ideas on the origin of modern humans. Instead, he left his audience with a cliffhanger:\nDarwin did not omit a discussion of human evolution in The Origin of Species due to the lack of interest. Rather, he feared that the discussion of human evolution would be perceived as too radical, and he did not want distract from the debate about the scientific merits of his ideas. Twelve years after the publication of The Origin of Species, Darwin followed up with a book devoted to human evolution and sexual selection (The Descent of Man, and Selection in Relation to Sex, first published in 1871); he wrote:\nUndoubtedly, Darwin was right. Over 160 years after the publication of The Origin of Species, evolutionary biology is still a controversial topic in some segments of our society, even though other scientific theories that clash with a literal interpretation of scripture—for example, the idea that Earth is round, heliocentrism, the Big Bang theory, and the germ theory of disease—have been more widely accepted. Be that as it may, Darwin predicted accurately; now, in the distant future from his time, researchers have thrown light on the origin of man. A treasure trove of fossil artifacts have not only provided clues about changes in our morphology and geographic distribution, but have also taught us how our ancestors manufactured tools, used fire, and hunted big game in prehistoric time. In addition, population genetic analyses of modern human populations—and more recently, genetic analyses of ancient DNA left by long-extinct ancestors—has shed light on human movement patterns, adaptation, and interaction with extinct lineages. In this chapter, we will first establish the evidence for the human phylogenetic position. Then, we will briefly explore what we have learned about human origins from the fossil record, and how modern molecular genetic approaches have transformed our ability to ask question about our nature and where we come from.",

    "section": "22.1 Phylogenetic Position",
    "text": "22.1 Phylogenetic Position\nIn 1735, Linnaeus was the first to classify humans alongside other animals. He assigned our species to the class called Quadrupeds (which later became Mammalia) and in the order Anthropomorpha (which later became Primates). Besides humans (genus Homo), Linnaeus’ Anthropomorpha also included the genera Simia (apes) and Bradypus (sloths). Thomas Henry Huxley—a fervent supporter of evolutionary thought that earned him the nickname “Darwin’s bulldog”—was the first to systematically investigate the phylogenetic position of humans relative to other primates, and since the publication of his work in 1863, countless studies have followed. Humans (Homo sapiens) are part of the taxon Catarrhini (Old World monkeys), which includes the superfamily Cercopithecoidea (24 genera with 138 species; including baboons, macaques, colobus, vervet, mangabey, mandrill, proboscis monkey, and many others) and the superfamily Hominoidea. Hominoidea is composed of two families (Figure @ref(fig:apes)): the Hylobatidae (4 genera and 18 species of gibbons) and the Homonidae (4 genera and 8 species of Great Apes). Hence, humans are closely related to the chimpanzees of Africa (genus Pan with 2 species), the gorillas of Africa (genus Gorilla with 2 species), and the orangutans of Indonesia and Malaysia (genus Pongo with 3 species).\nWhile morphological traits commonly used for phylogenetic inference and taxonomic classification unequivocally group humans with the other great apes, they do not offer sufficient information to resolve relationships within the family Hominidae. Specifically, morphological data alone was not able to falsify hypotheses about the relative position of humans, chimpanzees, and gorillas. For a long time, it was unclear whether humans and chimpanzees together were sister to gorillas, whether humans and gorillas together were sister to chimpanzees, or whether chimpanzees and gorillas together were sister to humans. Only the advent of molecular genetic approaches in 1960s and 1970s provided conclusive evidence that humans and the two species of chimpanzees are closely related with each other (Figure @ref(fig:apes)). Both genera are derived from a shared ancestor that lived in sub-Saharan Africa between 6.5-9.3 million years ago, which is consistent with fossil evidence estimating the divergence time at 6-10 million years ago (Moorjani et al. 2016).\n\n\n\n\n\nThe phylogenetic position of humans relative to other species within the taxon Catarrhini, which includes the family Hominidae (great apes) and Hylobatidae (gibbons). Adopted from Chatterjee et al. (2009).\n\n\n\n\nMolecular genetic analyses—spearheaded by the Human Genome Project that produced draft genomes for both humans and chimpanzees—have since revealed just how similar we are to our forest-dwelling cousins. At first sight, the key genetic difference between humans and chimpanzees appears to be a difference in chromosome numbers (chimps have 24 pairs, humans only 23). However, the human chromosome 2 is a composite of two chimpanzee chromosomes that fused into one, sometime after the split of our lineages. The order of genes on our second chromosome precisely matches the order of genes on the analogous chromosomes in chimpanzees. In addition, genome-wide analyses of sequence similarity have indicated that humans and chimpanzees share over 98 % of the nucleotide sequences—even 99.2 % in protein-coding regions. There are however, substantial differences in patterns of gene expression especially in the brain, suggesting that regulatory changes have played an important role in shaping the phenotypic differences between species.\n\nTable 14.1: Percent sequence difference between the genomes of humans and chimpanzees for different genetic regions.\n\n\nSequence type\nPercent difference\n\n\n\n\nPseudogenes\n1.68\n\n\nNon-coding, intergenic\n1.24\n\n\nNon-coding, intronic\n0.93\n\n\nCoding, synonymous\n1.11\n\n\nCoding, nonsynonymous\n0.80",

    "text": "22.2 What the Fossils Say\nHumans and chimpanzees may look very similar from a genomic perspective, but nobody can deny just how different we are in phenotype, especially in our lifestyles and behaviors. So, how did these differences arise? How did modern humans evolve from the ancestors we shared with chimpanzees just 6-10 million years ago? To address these questions, we first turn to the fossil record. Over the past century, scientists have unearthed fossil remnants that represent thousands of individual specimens, as well as stone tools and other artifacts that provide us with insights into human evolution. And unlike the gradual ape-to-man illustration so popular in museums and cartoons, the fossils show that there was no straight line of evolution from a distant ancestor to our present form. Instead, fossils indicate that there was a diversity of hominid forms that lived in sub-Saharan Africa and other portions of the planet. As we will see, how many different species this diversity represents and the relationship between different lineages is less clear.\n\n\n\n\n\nOverview of key fossil representatives since the human lineage split from the last common ancestor with chimpanzees. Additional details are provided in the text. Adopted from Wood and Grabowski (2015).\n\n\n\n\n\n22.2.1 An Abridged Timeline\nTo provide a general overview of the different types of fossils that we currently have available, I will briefly introduce some key groups that span the past 7 million years. This overview is by no means comprehensive, especially because the taxonomy of human fossil remains is constantly changing.\n\nPossible Early Hominids\nRemnants assigned to three different genera, Sahelanthropus, Orrorin, and Aridipithecus, are typically considered early hominins that represent lineages on the human side of the branch since the last common ancestor with chimpanzees. These fossils vary in age from about 7 million years (Sahelanthropus) to about 4.5 million years (Aridipithecus). All of these forms lack the characteristic features of later hominids. However, their are assumed to be among our ancestors because of peculiarities in their dentition and morphological adaptations of the pelvis and the hind limbs that suggest habitual (obligate) bipedal locomotion.\n\n\n\n\n\nA. Skull cast of Sahelenthropus tchadensis. Photo by Rama, CC BY-SA 3.0 FR. B. Sketch of an Aridipithecus skeleton. Illustration by Ori~, CC BY-SA 3.0.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nArchaic Hominins\nFossils assigned to two genera—Australipithecus and Kenyanthropus—are considered archaic hominins (also known as slender australopithecines) and span a time frame from roughly 2 to 4 million years ago. These forms are unambiguously hominin with predominantly bipedal locomotion, although their upper limb morphology suggest that they were still effective climbers. Evidence for bipedalism has not only been inferred from morphological adaptations in the skeleton, but also from spectacular footprints attributed to Australipithecus afarensis found in Laetoli, Tanzania (Figure @ref(fig:archaic)). Archaic humans also exhibited apelike skulls with projecting faces and large chewing teeth, albeit with reduced canines. All archaic hominins were relatively small (1.1-1.5 m tall; 30-45 kg). The brains of archaic hominins were slightly larger than those of earlier forms, but still substantially smaller than those of species from the genus Homo that evolved later. Note that assignment of different forms to either Australipithecus or Kenyanthropus, and the differentiation of species within those genera, largely depends on variation in the size and shape of teeth and other cranial features.\n\n\n\n\n\nA.

Masao et al. (2016).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMegadont and Hyper-Megadont Archaic Hominins\nAbout 2.5 million years ago, two distinctly different lineages appear in the fossil record: one includes fossils with more and more similarities to modern humans and is assigned to the genus Homo; the other has quite distinct cranial features and includes the genus Paranthropus (also known as robust australopithecines). Paranthropus includes so-called megadont and hyper-megadont forms that are characterized by extremely large post-canine teeth with exceptionally thick enamel. In addition, most Paranthropus exhibited a cranial crest that we also observe in modern carnivores. The cranial crest serves as an attachment point for powerful jaw muscles. Together, the dental modifications and cranial crest suggests that these hominins were adapted to powerful chewing (hence their nickname, nutcracker man). Otherwise, Paranthropus exhibited similar traits to the slender australopithecines; i.e., they were of small stature, had large faces, small brains, and predominantly bipedal locomotion. Interestingly, it has been suggested that Paranthropus exhibited a thumb morphology required for the manufacturing of simple tools. Some researchers have hypothesized that Paranthropus was responsible for the manufacturing of the oldest known stone tools (Oldowan tool) that are about 2.5 million years old.\n\n\n\n\n\nA.

Photo by José-Manuel Benito Álvarez, CC BY-SA 2.5.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTransitional Hominins\nConcurrently with Paranthropus, forms with unmistakably human characteristics started to appear about 2.5 million years ago. The oldest forms assigned to the genus Homo are H. habilis and H. rudolfensis. Both forms show a mix of morphology, with some traits seen in pre-modern Homo and some in archaic hominins. Hence, the generic placement of the two species is somewhat controversial, and some researchers argue that they should be placed in either Australipithecus or Kenyanthropus instead.\nTraits shared with older forms include long arms, a flat face, and large mandibles and postcanine teeth, which indicated that H. habilis and H. rudolfensis consumed mechanically demanding diets. Both forms, however, exhibited larger brain volumes and statures than archaic humans. Especially H. habilis fossils are frequently found with remains of butchered animals and simple stone tools, suggesting that they were hunters. They are widely considered to be the first humans to have manufactured stone tools at a large scales; hence, the epithet habilis (handy man).\n\n\n\n\n\nA. Skull of Homo habilis. B. Skull of H. rudolfensis. Photos by Hawks et al. (2017).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPre-Modern Hominins and Homo sapiens\nStarting about 1.8 million years ago, lineages appear that have modern humans’ characteristic postcranial morphology. Older forms still lack the distinctive size and shape of the modern human cranium, and they exhibit larger teeth and more robust jaws, but the similarities to modern humans get closer the younger the fossils are. Not surprisingly, there is tremendous variation in brain size in this group, ranging from about 600 to over 1,300 cm3.\nThe two earliest forms among pre-modern hominins are H. ergaster and H. erectus, which many scientists consider to the be same species (H. erectus). H. erectus is significant for many reasons, including its huge temporal range (1.8 million to 30,000 years ago) that overlapped with modern humans. In addition, H. erectus was the first hominin that left sub-Saharan Africa and colonized wide portions of Eurasia and and southeastern Asia. Compared to modern humans, H. erectus exhibited a smaller brain volume, larger teeth, and lacked a chin (Figure @ref(fig:erectheidel)A). However, H. erectus was of similar size and stature as us, and it was also the first human species to exhibit a flat face with a prominent nose and possibly a reduced coverage of body hair. Much controversy surrounds H. erectus’ ability to speak, but some researchers proposed that they communicated using some proto-language. African populations of H. erectus are likely the ancestors of later human forms (H. heidelbergensis and H. antecessor), which then gave rise to modern humans. Similarly, Asian populations of H. erectus have been hypothesized to be ancestral to H. floresiensis and other Asian hominins.\nTwo species that temporarily overlapped with H. erectus, and are likely derived from it, are H. antecessor (found in Spain) and H. heidelbergensis (found in primarily in Europe, but also northern Africa and parts of Asia; Figure @ref(fig:erectheidel)B). Fossils of these forms are about 100,000-600,000 years old. Both forms differ from modern humans in details of their cranial and dental morphology and bear a more robust postcranial skeleton, but they have increasingly large brains. H. heidelbergensis fossils are also accompanied by changing stone tools, suggesting technological advances compared to H. erectus. For example, there is evidence for the emergence of hafting (the attachment of rock tips to wooden shafts to create spears and axes) and for the regular use of fire in daily life about 400,000 years ago. Depending on the authority, H. antecessor or H. heidelbergensis is considered the direct ancestor of neanderthals and modern humans.\n\n\n\n\n\nA. Homo ergaster skull from Nariokotome, Lake Turkana area, Kenya. B. Homo heidelbergensis skull from Kabwe, central Zambia, southern Africa. Photos by James St. John, CC BY 2.0.\n\n\n\n\nFinally, there is fossil evidence for three additional species that survived until relatively recently: H. neanderthalensis from Europe, the Middle East, and part of Asia (400,000-20,000 years ago); an undescribed form known as Denisovans from Siberia that we will talk about in more detail later in this chapter; and H. florisiensis from the Indonesian island of Flores (74,000-16,000 years ago). All three forms widely coexisted with modern humans that start to appear in the fossil record about 300,000 years ago.\nNeanderthals were very similar to modern humans but exhibited a distinctly thick, double-arched brow ridge, a large nose, and other cranial peculiarities (Figure @ref(fig:sapnea)). On average, they had a larger brain volume than modern humans, and their hyoid bone—which in modern humans is associated with tongue mobility and speech—was identical to ours. Hence, it is widely assumed that H. neanderthalensis communicated through language. They used sophisticated technology; besides stone tools, they created fire, built cave hearths, made adhesives from plant sap, crafted clothes, wove, and traveled across stretches of water in rafts. Neanderthals are also suspected to have manufactured ornaments, simple instruments, and created the some of the oldest cave paintings that were previously attributed to modern humans.\n\n\n\n\n\nComparison of modern human (left) and Neanderthal skulls from the Cleveland Museum of Natural History. Illustration by hairymuseummatt (original photo) and DrMikeBaxter (derivative work), CC BY-SA 2.0.\n\n\n\n\nIn comparison, H. floriensis was spatially much more restricted and only occurred on a single island (Flores) in Indonesia (Figure @ref(fig:flores)). Adults only reached about 1.1 m in height, which is why this species is nicknamed “the hobbit”. H. floriensis is not closely related to the lineages the gave rise to modern humans, but is instead thought to be derived from H. erectus. Its small size is likely an example of island dwarfism, as also evidenced by diminutive elephants and hippos that existed alongside them. The discovery of H. florisensis in 2004 caused extensive media attention because it suggested that other hominins roamed Earth just 12,000 years ago.\n\n\n\n\n\nCave where the remainings of Homo floresiensis where discovered in 2003, Liang Bua, Flores, Indonesia.

Many modifications pertain to attributes of the skull. For example, there is a gradual forward movement of the foramen magnum (the hole in the base of the skull through which the spinal chord enters) that is likely a consequence of changed posture and bipedalism. In addition, canines become smaller, molars larger, and there is a decrease in prognathism (i.e., the extent to which the bottom part of the face juts forward). Finally, there is a clear increase in cranial capacity and a general rounding of the skull. All of these morphological changes are reflective or correlated with three major trends: the evolution of bipedal locomotion, a non-honing chewing complex and changed diets, and a stark encephalization of the brain.\n\nBipedalism\nWhile other great apes are capable of facultative bipdalism, human habitually walk on two feet (we are obligate bipeds). The transition from quadrupedalism to bipedalism is actually one of the earliest evolutionary trends, and skeletal modifications associated with increased bipedalism have been inferred even in early hominids (Sahelanthropus, Orrorin, and especially Aridipithecus). The transition toward bipedal locomotion is associated with a wealth of skeletal changes, from the position of the foramen magnum, to the shape of the spinal chord and the structure of lumbar vertebrae, to the shape and position of the pelvis. In addition, there were changes in leg and foot anatomy, and the arms shorted as climbing and swinging became less important modes of locomotion. All of these changes occurred gradually across several million years of evolution, and fully bipedal locomotion likely did not occur until about 4 million years ago with Australipithecus. Why exactly hominins shifted from walking on all fours to walking on two feet remains a matter of controversy. Some of the most prominent hypotheses highlight the efficiency of locomotion and predator recognition in open savannas (as opposed to the ancestral forested habitats). In addition, a shift to bipedalism may have freed up the hands to perform tasks other than locomotion, such as the carrying of food or offspring or the use of tools.\n\n\nNon-Honing Chewing Complex\nCompared to other great apes, humans have highly reduced canines and enlarged molars (Figure @ref(fig:canine)). The large canines in the upper jaw of apes are equipped with a sharpened posterior edge. Every time the jaws close, that edge is sharpened by rubbing against the third premolar in the lower jaw, which makes up the so-called “honing (sharpening) complex”. Not surprisingly, the sharp canines play an important role in great ape foraging, as they cut and shred leaves, fruit, and other foods. In contrast, along with the reduction in canine size, humans have gradually lost the honing complex. The overall changes in dentition likely reflects changes in dietary habits, tool use, and the use of fire to cook food items prior to consumption.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe size of canines in the upper and lower jaw from different species of great apes, including humans and two species of Australopithecus. Data from Ward et al. (2010).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBrain Encephalization\nPerhaps most importantly, human evolution is characterized by a continuous increase of brain size—both in terms of the size of the brain relative to body mass and absolute brain size. Gains in cranial volume increased only moderately at first; but starting with early forms of Homo, brains got substantially bigger very quickly (Figure @ref(fig:brain)A). In H. erectus alone, brain volume increased by about 50 % compared to transitional Homo. The largest brains were found in H. neanderthalensis, which had slightly bigger brains than anatomically modern humans. Note that the same patterns were found when researchers inferred the amount of blood flow through the internal carotid artery, which supplies the brain (Figure @ref(fig:brain)B).\nConsistent with increases in brain size, there is also evidence for changes in brain structure and morphology. For example, the brains of non-human primates and early hominins were symmetrical, and there is evidence for increasing lateralization (tendency for some neural functions or cognitive processes to be specialized to one side of the brain or the other) through time. The subdivision into a left and right side of the brain is not only evident in modern humans, but also in endocasts—trace fossils of that arise when minerals replace soft tissues during fossilization—from earlier hominins. Endocasts also indicate significant changes in the cerebellum (associated with learned motor activities), the limbic system (involved in emotion and social communication), and the cerebral cortex (processing of sensory experiences). It is tempting to speculate that these changes in brain structure—and likely function—were directly related to changes in social organization, technological advances, and cultural practices like language.\n\n\n\n\n\nA.

Data from Du et al. (2018). B. Estimates of blood frow through the internal carotid artery into the brain for different hominids. Data from Seymour et al. (2016).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n22.2.3 A Lone Survivor of an Extinct Radiation\nThe fossil record clearly disproves the common notion of a straight evolutionary line between the common ancestor we shared with chimpanzees and modern humans, with gradual changes from small-brained quadrupeds to large-brained bipeds. Rather, there is clear evidence for a diversification of lineages around 4 million years ago. For most of the time since, multiple species of humans have coexisted in different parts of Africa and Eurasia, and in some cases there is also clear evidence that these species interacted ecologically. While the diversity of prehistoric humans reached a peak around 2 million years ago, there is robust evidence that even modern humans—which appear in the fossil record a mere 300,000 years ago—temporally overlapped with H. neanderthalensis, H. heidelbergensis, H. floresiensis, and likely even H. erectus. As we will see, there is also direct evidence that anatomically modern humans interacted with H. neanderthalensis, Denisovans, H. heidelbergensis and other distinct lineages that we do not know in detail. Hence, our lineage—the contemporary H. sapiens—represents a lone survivor from a considerable and likely underestimated diversity of related forms that existed for the better part of the past 4 million years.\nWhile the fossil record has offered profound insights into our origins, it is important to also emphasize what it cannot tell us about human evolution. First and foremost, we do not know what forms actually represent different species incapable of interbreeding. The taxonomy of fossil remains hinges on the analysis of skeletal characteristics, assessed mostly from incomplete skeletons. Hence, we may be overestimating the past species diversity, if some of the more subtle morphological differences are reflective of intraspecific variation, perhaps in relation to geography. However, we may also be underestimating the past species diversity if the current fossil record is incomplete or if important species differences are not inferable from the partial remains that we have available.\nThe fossil record also leaves us largely ignorant about the phylogenetic relationship of different forms we know. Remember, Huxley was unable to resolve the phylogenetic relationship among gorillas, chimpanzees, and humans based on the analysis of skeletal traits. Needless to say that this task is not made any easier when more closely related and less complete skeletons are analyzed. So, while Astralopithecus afarensis is often assumed to be the ancestor of Paranthropus and Homo species, or H. heidelbergensis the ancestor of H. neanderthalensis and H. sapiens, we cannot test those hypotheses conclusively with the data available. Inferring evolutionary relationships and processes, especially in deeper time, is challenging because of the comparatively scant lines of evidence. However, it is important to remember just how young we are as a species. If we ask how exactly modern humans arose from the diversity of lineages that are evident in the fossil record, we can leverage a much broader toolset to test hypotheses framed on the basis of insights provided by fossils.",

    "section": "22.3 Modern Human Origins",
    "text": "22.3 Modern Human Origins\nA number of of hypotheses have been proposed to explain the origin of Homo sapiens. The different hypotheses cover a range of possibilities about how anatomically modern forms may have arisen from more archaic hominids. I will briefly introduce each hypothesis, and then we will examine the evidence for the alternative scenarios.\n\n22.3.1 Hypotheses\nOn one extreme of the spectrum of modern human origins is the candelabra hypothesis, whose most prominent proponent was anthropologist Carleton Coon. The candelabra hypothesis posits that anatomically modern humans arose in Africa, Asia, and Europe from archaic forms that had colonized these regions earlier (Figure @ref(fig:hypotheses)A). Under this scenario, modern humans in different geographic regions evolved independently, and shared characteristics among lineages would be the product of convergent evolution. Coon mostly used this idea to justify and propagate his racist ideologies. He believed—without actual evidence, of course—that the transformation from archaic to modern humans started in European populations first, which in his eyes proved why Europeans were so advanced compared to he considered to be more primitive peoples of other regions. The candelabra hypothesis is firmly rooted in scientific racism and eugenics, both debunked pseudosciences that remind us of the painful historical track record of biology and notions of race. Even if we set the racist connotations aside, there is just no merit to the idea that modern humans represent multiple, deeply divergent evolutionary lineages, which is why candelabra is mentioned here more as a historical side note.\nSimilar to candelabra, the second hypothesis of modern human origins—the multiregional evolution hypothesis—proposes that archaic humans colonized Eurasia from Africa about 1 million years ago, and they then diverged in different geographic regions while remaining connected through gene flow (Figure @ref(fig:hypotheses)B). The time estimate of emigration out of Africa is based on the age of H. erectus fossils that appear in Eurasia around that time.\nIn contrast, the third hypothesis—the out-of-Africa hypothesis—proposes that there were two waves of emigration of African Homo that colonized Eurasia. A first wave involved H. erectus, which colonized Eurasia about 1 million years ago; again, consistent with the fossil record for that species. However, the out-of-Africa hypothesis also postulates that anatomically modern human originated in Africa. Modern humans then dispersed out of Africa much more recently (100,000-200,000 years ago) and displaced the other hominins in Eurasia that settled there before (Figure @ref(fig:hypotheses)C). The replacement of ancient lineages by modern H. sapiens derived from Africa is why this hypothesis is also known as the African replacement hypothesis.\nLast but not least, the hybridization-and-assimilation hypothesis is very similar to the out-of-Africa hypothesis, in that it assumes an African origin of modern humans. However, instead of replacing more ancient lineages during the colonization of Eurasia, this hypothesis proposes that newly-arriving modern H. sapiens hybridized with other forms of Homo that colonized these areas (Figure @ref(fig:hypotheses)D). Hybridization essentially led to the assimilation—or fusion—of different lineages.\nIn the following sections, we will first address the multiregional evolution and the out-of-Africa hypotheses, which make contrasting predictions that can be address using phylogenetic and population genetic analyses of extant human populations. As you will see, there is overwhelming evidence for an African origin of modern humans and relatively recently migrations to colonize Eurasia and other portions of the planet. In a second step, we will then weigh the evidence for the out-of-Africa and the hybridization and assimilation hypotheses. Juxtaposing these alternative scenarios has become feasible in the past decade, as technological breakthroughs have enabled us to sequence the DNA of long-dead ancestors, including members of H. neanderthalensis and other extinct species.\n\n\n\n\n\nHypotheses explaining the origin of modern himans (see text for details): A. candelabra hypothesis; B. multiregional; C. out-of-Africa (or African replacement) hypothesis; D. hybridization-and-assimilation hypothesis.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n22.3.2 Multiregional Evolution vs. Out-Of-Africa\nThe multiregional evolution and out-of-Africa hypotheses make contrasting predictions that are based on evidence from the fossil record. We know that H. erectus was the first hominin to leave Africa and colonize Eurasia. Evidence of fossil bones and manufactured tools suggest that migrations of H. erectus started about 1.8 million years ago, and within 500,000 years the distribution of these ancient humans reached as far as China and Indonesia. It is important to note that these are conservative estimates, especially since new fossil discoveries from China suggest that the start of Eurasian colonization may in fact have occurred significantly earlier than what we had assumed. In contrast, fossil remains of anatomically modern humans are much younger. The oldest known fossils are between 200,000 and 300,000 years old and were all found on the African continent, including Morocco, Ethiopia, and South Africa. The oldest H. sapiens fossil outside of Africa was recently discovered in Israel and is about 185 million years old. In addition, a wealth of other modern human remains have been found in the Middle East and are dated at 90,000-120,000 years before present.\nIf the multiregional evolution hypothesis were true and modern humans in different geographic regions were derived from H.-erectus-like forms, then we would predict the divergence time between extant African and non-African human populations to be more than 1 million years, consistent with the fossil traces left behind by H. erectus. In contrast, if modern humans arose in Africa and then emigrated to and replaced more ancient humans in Eurasia, then the divergence time between African and non-African populations should be less than 200,000 years. The two hypotheses also make contrasting predictions about the location of ancestral lineages; they should be dispersed randomly across Africa and Eurasia if the multiregional evolution hypothesis was true, but restricted to Africa if the out-of-Africa hypothesis was true. Both of these predictions—the one related to divergence time and the one related to the location of ancestral lineages—can be addressed through phylogenetic analyses of extant human populations.\nTwo additional predictions arise from the population genetic consequences of dispersal and the effects of genetic drift associated with founder effects. As discussed in Chapter 6, founder effects occur when a random subset of individuals in a population disperses to a new geographic area and establishes new populations. In this case, only a subset of alleles present in the ancestral population is carried along. The out-of-Africa hypothesis—in which such a founder effect occurs—consequently predicts reduced genetic diversity and the presence of only a subset of neutral alleles in non-African populations compared to Africans. In contrast, the multiregional evolution hypothesis—in which such a founder effect does not occur—predicts that levels of genetic diversity are equal and the presence of sets of neutral alleles randomly distributed among human populations in different geographic regions. This second set of hypotheses are testable through population genetic analyses of extant human populations.\n\nTable 14.1: Summary of contrasting predictions between the out-of-Africa and the multiregional evolution hypotheses.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrediction\nMultiregional evolution\nOut-of-Africa\n\n\n\n\nDivergence time between African and non-African populations\n&gt;1,000,000 years\n&lt;200,000 years\n\n\nLocation of ancestral lineages\nRandom\nAfrica\n\n\nLevels of genetic diversity\nNot significantly different among geographic regions\nHighest in Africa, reduced everywhere else\n\n\nSets of neutral alleles\nEach geographic regions has unique alleles; no region’s alleles are a subset of another region’s\nOnly African populations have unique alleles; alleles present in non-African populations are a subset of those in Africa\n\n\n\nSo, what is the evidence for and against the multiregional evolution and out-of-Africa hypotheses? Max Ingman and his colleagues (2000) were among the first to rigorously test these phylogenetic predictions by analyzing the mitochondrial DNA of 53 humans of diverse geographic provenance. The phylogeny they reconstructed (Figure @ref(fig:modhuphy)) provides unequivocal support for the out-of-Africa hypotheses. The age of the shared ancestor of all modern human population was estimated at about 170,000 years. More importantly, the age of the youngest clade containing both African and non-African populations (marked with an orange dot in Figure @ref(fig:modhuphy)) was estimated at around 52,000 years, falling squarely within the range of predictions for out-of-Africa, but not multiregional evolution. In addition, the phylogeny also indicated that ancestral lineages are restricted to the African continent, and they do not occur randomly across the continents as predicted by the multiregional evolution hypothesis. More recent phylogenetic analyses based on partial and whole-genome sequences of nuclear DNA have largely corroborated these results, even though humans have likely left Africa earlier. The most recent estimates put the exodus of modern humans from Africa at around 200,000 years ago.\n\n\n\n\n\nPhylogeny based on mitochondrial DNA sequences of extant human populations. African and non-African populations are indicated in color, and the estimated divergence times are indicated for the last common ancestor of all humans as well as the youngest clade containing both African and non-African populations. Adopted from Ingman et al. (2000).\n\n\n\n\nJust like phylogenetic analyses, population genetic analyses that survey patterns of genetic variation have also uncovered evidence for the out-of-Africa hypothesis. Research on mitochondrial DNA, hypervariable microsatellites, transposable elements, and—most recently—whole-genome sequencing has found the highest levels of genetic variation in African populations, and reduced variation in non-African populations. For example, genetic variation estimated in 51 populations at 650,000 loci within the human genome revealed a clear negative correlation between heterozygosity and the distance of a population to Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, which is proximate to the presumed cradle of modern humans (Figure @ref(fig:gendiv)A). This is consistent with sequential founder effects that reduced genetic variation as bands of humans ventured ever farther away and established new populations, even in distant and isolated regions of Oceania and the Americas. Genetic analyses have also revealed that unique neutral alleles are not randomly distributed across different geographic regions. Rather, unique alleles are largely restricted to Africa, and alleles in other regions represent a mere subset of African alleles (Figure @ref(fig:gendiv)B).\n\n\n\n\n\nA. Relationship between the genetic diversity (heterozygosity) of 51 human populations and their distance from Addis Ababa, Ethiopia. Data from Li et al. (2008). B. Frequency of different CD4 STRP alleles in African and non-African populations both for Alu(+) and Alu(-) chromosomes. Non-African alleles are clearly a subset of alleles present in African populations. Data from Tishkoff et al. (1996).\n\n\n\n\nConsequently, both phylogenetic and population genetic analyses have resoundingly rejected the multiregional evolution hypothesis. Modern humans in different geographic regions are not derived from ancient H. erectus that left Africa in excess of 1,000,000 years ago. Instead, our species originated on the African continent relatively recently and then left to colonize the rest of the world around 200,000 years ago. The question then becomes: what happened as those modern human colonizers encountered other forms of Homo that had already settled all across Eurasia? The fossil evidence clearly indicates that those areas were not only occupied by H. erectus, but also H. heidelbergensis, H. neanderthalensis, and other lesser-known members of the genus Homo. Insights into the outcome of the interactions between modern humans and other homominids have only become available recently, as we have developed the capability to analyzing ancient DNA left behind by our ancestors.\n\n\n22.3.3 Out-of-Africa vs. Hybridization-and-Assimilation\nIn 1997, a rumble went through the science world. For the first time in history, Svante Pääbo and his team were able to extract DNA from the skeletal remains of an extinct human, a specimen of H. neanderthalensis that lived about 40,000 years ago (Krings et al. 1997). By 2017, scientists had sequenced partial or complete genomes from more than 1,100 ancient human and archaic hominin individuals, rewriting our understanding of our own evolutionary history. While analyses of these ancient DNA samples confirmed an African origin of anatomically modern humans, followed by dispersal to other portions of our planet, the new findings also revised the timing of events in our history and shed new light into how we interacted with other forms of Homo that had already settled all over Eurasia.\nSequencing of ancient DNA confirmed that Neanderthals indeed represented a distinct evolutionary lineage that diverged about 500,000 years ago from the ancestors of anatomically modern humans (Figure @ref(fig:ancientphylo)). Furthermore, clues left behind in the DNA of those ancient bones also revealed that we are likely underestimating the diversity of hominins that lived in the recent past and interacted with modern humans. For example, DNA extracted from finger bones found in the Denisova cave in Siberia turned out to be neither modern human nor Neanderthal in origin. Instead, these finger bones are the remains of a lineage that diverged from our shared ancestors with Neandertals roughly 900,000 years ago (Figure @ref(fig:ancientphylo)). Besides information encoded in the DNA, we have little knowledge about these so-called Denisovans, which is why they still await formal scientific description. The current lack of fossil traces, beyond the finger bones we currently have available, makes it impossible to know how the Denisovan’s features may have compared to ours and other extinct lineages.\nDNA sequencing also shed light into the identity of fossils found in Sima de los Huesos, Spain. These fossils have long stirred controversy about the age and identity of Neanderthals, because they bear a striking resemblance to Neanderthals even though they are much older than all the other Neanderthal fossils we know. DNA analyses settled these debates to some degree, as the fossils from Sima de los Huesos are not actually closely related to Neanderthals. Rather, these ancient fossils are more closely related to the Denisovans, with which they shared a common ancestor around 700,000 years ago. Given the deep divergences, some researchers have speculated that that the Sima de los Huesos fossils may represent H. heidelbergensis. Overall, these exciting findings clearly show how a wealth of pre-modern humans existed not only in Africa but over wide stretches Eurasia as well. Given that DNA preserves best in the colder climates of northern latitudes but degrades fast in warmer and more humid subtropical and tropical climates, we are likely underestimating the past diversity simply because we have no ancient DNA specimens from those locations.\n\n\n\n\n\nPhylogeny modern humann and pre-modern Homo for which we have ancient DNA available. This tree was derived from mitochondrial genome sequences and includes divergence time estimates for critical nodes. Adopted from Meyer et al. (2014). Inserts show crania collected at Lima de los Huesos. Photo of lateral view by UtaUtaNapishtim, CC BY-SA 4.0, photo of frontal view from Sala et al. (2015).\n\n\n\n\nThe availability of ancient DNA not only allowed us to confirm the evolutionary distinctness of different pre-modern humans and clarify the temporal patterns of diversification, but it also provided the template necessary to ask whether any modern humans exhibit genetic similarities to extinct forms. In other words, ancient DNA allows us to contrast the out-of -Africa and the hybridization-and-assimilation hypotheses (Figure @ref(fig:hypotheses)C-D). If modern humans indeed replaced pre-modern forms as they dispersed out of Africa, we would not expect to find any DNA sequences with close similarities to those from pre-modern humans in extant populations. Alternatively, if at least some modern humans carry DNA that bears similarities to the DNA of Neanderthals or other extinct forms, then interactions between the modern new arrivals from Africa and the more ancient lineages already settled in Eurasia may not have been purely antagonistic. Instead, it would indicate that modern humans hybridized with those ancient forms.\nPerhaps not surprisingly, we now have unequivocal evidence that modern humans indeed interbred with Neanderthals as they emigrated out of Africa. Introgression of Neanderthal DNA is especially common in Eurasia, the Middle East, and North Africa, where we also have evidence for the sympatry of both species based on the fossil record (Figure @ref(fig:nea)). In contrast, evidence for introgression is comparatively rare in extant human populations from sub-Saharan Africa, which did not exhibit significant range overlap with Neanderthals (Figure @ref(fig:nea)). These findings substantially rewrite the history of human evolution, because they suggest that Neanderthals never really went extinct. Instead, they were simply assimilated into the gene pool of modern humans, and hence, traces of their existence continue to live on in many of us. Rather than being some distant relative that also inhabited this planet in the past, Neanderthals are actually among our ancestors.\nThe bits of Neaderthal DNA still present in non-African extant humans are not simply non-functional stretches of junk DNA, but many remain functional and impact the expression in phenotypic traits. For example, Neanderthal DNA has been linked to the morphology of our cranium and brain, the coloration of eyes, hair, and skin, as well as aspects of our immune system. If you have light skin, blond or red hair, or blue or green eyes, you most certainly have inherited those traits from your Neanderthal ancestors. Introgression of these specific genes may have been driven by natural selection and helped newly arriving human populations adapt to life at higher latitudes. By the time modern humans arrived from Africa, Neanderthals had already lived and adapted to the specific environmental conditions at high latitudes for about 300,000 years, carrying allelic variants that had proven beneficial. Interbreeding allowed these beneficial alleles to be introduced into the modern human population, and selection swept them to high frequency.\n\n\n\n\n\nEstimated proportions of Neanderthal introgression in different human populations (based on a metric called f4 ratio). Data from Vyas and Mulligan (2019)\n\n\n\n\nInterbreeding, it turns out, was not restricted to Neanderthals and modern humans. We also have evidence for interbreeding between Neanderthals and Denisovans, as well as Denisovans and modern humans (Figure @ref(fig:humanintro)). For example, about 5 % of the genome of people from Oceania is derived from Denisovans. Again, traits associated with pigmentation and immune function in those populations are likely derived from these extinct ancestors. Moreover, genes that have been associated with high-elevation adaptation in Tibetans also appear to have originated from admixture with Denisovans. Finally, analyses of genomic similarities across modern humans, Neanderthals, and Denisovans suggests that patterns of interbreeding also include a fourth member of the genus Homo. So far, we don’t know the identity of this fourth species, because we do not have a matching reference genome. However, scientists have speculated that it may be H. heidelbergensis or H. erectus based on the fossil record, which overlapped with the other species both spatially and temporally.\n\n\n\n\n\nPatterns of historical gene flow between different lineages of pre-modern and modern Homo. Adopted from Pfrüfer et al. (2014).\n\n\n\n\nIn conclusion, the history of recent human evolution is not really a bifurcating phylogenetic tree. Rather it may be better represented by a web of gene flow among divergent lineages. This, of course, raises questions about how many species are actually represented in the fossil record. Clearly, reproductive isolation among these lineages was not complete; otherwise, we would not be able to uncover evidence of widespread hybridization. However, depletion of Neanderthal DNA around functional genomic regions in extant humans suggests that there may have been deleterious epistatic interactions between Neanderthal and modern human alleles. One study estimated the fitness cost of hybridization with Neanderthals at about 0.5 % (Harris and Nielsen 2016)—not huge, but still sufficient for natural selection to cause substantial changes in allele frequencies through time.\nThe speed at which we have been—and continue to be—learning about our own evolutionary history is staggering. New studies employing revolutionary technologies and analyzing ever-more and ever-older samples are being published almost on a weekly basis. Just in February 2021, the record for the oldest DNA ever sequenced was shattered with the publication of the genome of a mammoth that lived between 1.1 and 1.6 million years ago (van der Valk 2021). No doubt, we can anticipate learning more exciting information about the nature of our ancestors and ourselves!",

    "section": "22.4 What Makes Us Human?",
    "text": "22.4 What Makes Us Human?\nAt the end of this chapter, you might be wondering what it really is that make us human, different from all the other creatures with which we share the planet. Scientists and philosophers have pondered this question for millennia. If you ask a biologist, they are likely to talk about how the anatomy of our hand, especially an additional muscle that facilitates additional mobility of the thumb, is very different from other apes and facilitated our extensive use of tools. Or they might highlight the peculiar shape of our hyoid bone, which allows us to articulate a much wider variety of sounds and likely facilitated the evolution of our complex languages. And they will surely highlight the magnificent complexity of our large brains, which make us exquisite learners. Because of our brain, information is not just passed across generations through our DNA, but also through cultural practices that play an important role in our survival and social interactions. It’s this magnificent brain that made us into the ultimate survival machine and the most invasive species on the planet. It made us into a species that appreciates art, ponders the meaning of life, and looks beyond Earth into the depths of the universe.\nBut who are we to say that no other animals share some of these same experiences? Certainly other creatures use tools and communicate in quite sophisticated ways. Elephants that carefully examine the remains of friends and family may experience feelings of grief, just like us. And who knows how many creatures look at the stars in the night sky, feeling humbled by how small and insignificant they are in the big scheme of things, and wondering why they are really there…\nI will offer you my very own and very biased perspective of what makes us human: our ability to use fire and cook our food. No other species on the planet processes food quite the same way we do, and some researchers have speculated that food processing allowed us to extract more nutrients from our food items, thus facilitating the evolution of our costly brains… and everything that comes along with them.\nSo, I will end this book about evolution with a simple recipe—from my ancestors to you. Cook it for a loved one—or just for yourself, you deserve it—and I promise you will have a quintessential human experience in the process.\n\nPasta Insieme A Sugo Di Pomodoro\nYes… it’s just pasta with tomato sauce, but it is 🤤\nSugo\n\n4 tablespoons of olive oil\n8 cloves of garlic, finely chopped\n2 pounds of fresh tomatoes (get some of those sweet heirlooms if you can)\nA dozen or two basil leaves, finely cut\nSalt and pepper to taste\n\nBring some water to a boil in a sauce pan, add the tomatoes, and simmer for 3 minutes; then remove the tomatoes, peel the skin, remove the seeds, and cut them into small pieces. Then heat up the olive oil and carefully brown the garlic (slow… don’t burn it), add the tomatoes, and let it simmer for about 20 minutes. Add salt and pepper to taste, and add the basil just before you are ready to serve.\nPasta\n\n1.5 cups of wheat flour\n1.5 cups of semola flour\n4 large eggs\n\nSift the two flours together into a bowl, make a hole in the center with your hand, and add the eggs into the hole; then use your fingers mix the eggs with the flour (go slow, incorporating more and more flour as you go). Once the dough is uniform, knead it for 10 minutes (if its hard to knead because the dough is too dry, add a little water; if the dough is sticky, add a little flour); then make a ball, wrap it in plastic wrap, and let it rest for 30 minutes. After that, you can roll your dough and cut your noodles using a pasta maker, or you can use a rolling pin and a sharp knife instead. To cook the pasta, add it to a pot of well-salted boiling water for about 2 minutes.\nServe\nDrain the pasta and add it to bowl, top it with your freshly-made sugo, and shave some Parmesan cheese on top. My ancestors typically enjoyed this with a glass of red wine:)",

While classic biomedical research has focused on understanding the molecular and physiological underpinnings of diseases, Darwinian medicine (or evolutionary medicine) is also concerned with how evolutionary history and evolutionary processes have impacted our propensity to contract diseases. Such approaches have lead to important insights about the biology of cancers, autoimmune diseases, and evolving pathogens. Table 12.1 lists some core principles of evolutionary medicine based on recommendation of The Association of American Medical Colleges and the Howard Hughes Medical Institute (Grunspan et al. 2018). While some medical schools have been slow to adopt the inclusion of evolutionary principles into their curricula, rigorous evolution education is now commonplace among healthcare professionals.\nWe have already covered a wide range of topics associated with core concepts in evolutionary medicine, albeit not always in the explicit context of human health and disease. In this and the next chapter, we will explore select topics in more depth. First, we will examine how mismatches between modern environments and those of our ancestors impact our susceptibility to non–communicable diseases, and explore why we age and die. In the next chapter, we will discuss how evolutionary principles inform our understanding of pathogen spread and evolution, and how we can use cultural practices to impact disease dynamics in our population.",

    "section": "23.2 Diseases of Civilization",
    "text": "23.2 Diseases of Civilization\nHuman populations have undoubtedly evolved a wide variety of adaptations to local environmental conditions and lifestyles. Recent research has not only identified a number of phenotypic traits associated with adaptations to different diets, pathogens, oxygen levels, cold resistance, and exposure to very high or very low levels of UV (Table 12.2), but in many cases also found candidate genes that underlie adaptive trait variation in specific populations (Rees et al 2020). In all of these cases, local adaptation has evolved in response to very specific sources of selection, often over time periods spanning thousands of years. For example, evolution of lactase persistence was associated with the domestication of cattle and other dairy animals about 10,000 years ago, leading to an increase in lactase persistence alleles over the past 5,000 years, until they reached present-day levels (see Chapter 5). Similarly, human populations that traditionally eat a high-starch diet exhibit a high copy number of amylase genes (AMY1) compared to populations that traditionally eat a low-starch diet (Figure @ref(fig:amylase)A). AMY1 genes encode the enzyme amylase, which is responsible for catalyzing the hydrolysis of complex cabrohydrates to simple sugars during digestion, and copy number variation is directly correlated with the amount of amylase produced in the saliva (Figure @ref(fig:amylase)B). The surge of lactase persistence alleles in populations consuming diary and the high amylase copy numbers in populations eating a lot of starchy foods exemplify how evolution has shaped traits associated with digestion in response to cultural practices (i.e., regional food preferences).\n\nTable 12.2: Examples of local adaptation in human populations based on Rees et al. (2020).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdaptation\nPopulation with adaptations\n\n\n\n\nDiet\n\n\n\nLactase persistence\nEurasians and Africans\n\n\nFatty diets\nGreenlandic Inuit\n\n\nStarchy diets\nAcross different populations\n\n\nLow selenium levels\nChinese\n\n\nLow iron levels\nEuropeans\n\n\nLow calcium levels\nNon-Africans\n\n\nFrequent starvation\nSamoans\n\n\nPathogens\n\n\n\nMalaria resistance\nSub-Saharan Africans\n\n\nAfrican sleeping sickness\nWestern Africans\n\n\nHepatitis C\nEuropeans\n\n\nOxidative stress\n\n\n\nHigh altitude\nTibetans, Andeans, and Ethiopians\n\n\nBreath-holding diving\nBajau (Indonesia)\n\n\nCold resistance\n\n\n\nCold perception\nEurasians\n\n\nEnergy regulation, metabolism, and cardiovascular function\nSiberians\n\n\nDifferentiation of brown and brite adipocytes\nGreenlandic Inuit\n\n\nUV exposure\n\n\n\nPigmentation changes\nAcross different populations\n\n\nLow vitamin D levels\nNorthern Europeans\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA.

Data from Perry et al. (2007).\n\n\n\n\nThe onset of agriculture 10,000 years ago was not the last time that human lifestyles have changed dramatically. Perhaps the most important change in recent human evolution was the the industrial revolution, which occurred between 1760 and 1840. This time period was marked by a transition in manufacturing processes, initially in Europe and the United States, where goods previously made by hand were now produced with machines powered by steam and, later, electricity. The industrial revolution led to unprecedented human population growth and population connectivity associated with increased globalization. During this time, almost every aspect of daily life changed. Humans changed the ways they moved around, transitioning from walking to using transportation. The structure of social interactions changed both at larger scales (aggregation of people into growing urban centers) and at smaller scales (changes in family structures and the social roles of men and women). Humans had increasing access to medical treatments, but also increasing exposure to environmental pollutants. And perhaps most significantly, humans completely changed what they ate; today most foods are industrially processed products made from cereal grains, refined sugars, and an excess of trans and saturated fats. In many ways, our modern life bears little resemblance to that of our ancestors.\n\n23.2.1 Modern Hunter-Gatherers and Urbanites\nThe profound changes to our environment and our lifestyles over the past 10,000 years—really, mostly over the past 250 years—are illustrated by comparing modern urbanites and modern hunter-gatherers. Modern hunter-gatherers still obtain the majority of their food by foraging and hunting, similar to most humans prior to the sedentary agricultural societies that arose 10,000 years ago. Modern hunter-gatherers include the Inuit and Iñupiat peoples from Arctic regions in North America and Greenland, the Huaorani and Yąnomamö peoples in South America, the Orang Patek peoples of Palawan, the Pila Nguru of Australia, as well as the Bayaka and San peoples of sub-Saharan Africa, among many others (Figure @ref(fig:hgdiet)A). While modern urbanites walk an average of 2.5 km per day and burn energy at a rate of about 1.18 times the resting metabolic rate, hunter-gatherers of the !Kung in the Kalahari desert and the Aché in Paraguay walk between 14.9 and 19.2 km per day and burn energy at a rate of 1.71-2.15 times the resting metabolic rate (Cordain et al. 1997). At the same time, hunter-gatherers have a lower caloric intake (~3,000 kcal/day vs. 3,600 kcal/day in an average American), and their diet primarily consists of lean game, fish and shellfish, eggs, fruits, vegetables, and other plant products (although there are staggering geographic and cultural differences; Figure @ref(fig:hgdiet)B). Hunter-gatherer diets are also exceedingly nutritious, providing vitamins, minerals, and dietary fibers at rates that far exceed the recommended daily allowances set by the U.S. Food and Nutrition Board (Eaton and Konner 1997).\nNot surprisingly, our sedentary lifestyles and splurges rich in sugar, fat, and alcohol have been associated with a wide variety of health issues. Average Americans exhibit higher blood cholesterol levels (204 mg/dl vs. 121 in !Kung and 141 in Inuit) and higher body mass indices (&gt;29 in 2018 vs. 19 in !Kung and 24 in Inuit; Leonard 2002). More over, our modern lifestyles and diets have been associated with a wide variety of health conditions that are comparatively rare or even absent in hunter-gatherer communities: cardiovascular diseases like heart attacks and strokes; cancer in a variety of forms; autoimmune diseases like diabetes, celiac disease, and multiple sclerosis; neurodegenerative diseases like Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s disease; and mental health issues like depression, anxiety, and substance abuse. Due to the rarity of these diseases in hunter-gatherer communities and the documented links to lifestyle and eating habits, these diseases are also know as “diseases of civilization” or “lifestyle diseases”. The impacts of diseases of civilization are profound. While over 60 % of deaths in the U.S. in 1900 were caused by infectious diseases, by 1940 the majority of deaths were associated with with heart disease, cancers, and non-communicable diseases. Today, 7 out of the 10 leading causes of death in the U.S. are non-communicable and have significant risk factors associated with modern life.\n\n\n23.2.2 Old Adaptations in a Modern World\nHuman populations—with their large census sizes and accordingly large pools of standing genetic variation—are undoubtedly able to respond to selection and adapt to changing environmental conditions. As explained above, we know how the increase in dairy and starchy foods during the advent of agriculture exerted selection on a variety of digestive enzymes, leading to high frequencies of lactose persistence alleles (Chapter 5) and high copy numbers of amylase genes (Figure @ref(fig:amylase)). Evolutionary change in humans is thus certainly responsive to the cultural practices that vary among populations. Still, evolution obviously takes time, and many of the drastic changes in diet and lifestyle only date back a handful of generations. Change in cultural practices—which has happened in just a few generations—has consequently outpaced evolutionary change by natural selection.\nAs we study adaptive trait variation in humans, we consequently need to ask ourselves what environments humans are actually adapted to. The environments experienced by modern urbanites—and even those of our ancestors within the past few millenia, since the start of recorded history (~5,000 years ago)—bear little resemblance to the environments humans experienced for the vast majority of their evolutionary history. Considering that anatomically modern Homo sapiens emerged around 300,000 years ago, even the advent of agriculture only reaches back into about 3 % of our species’ history. Many of the traits that make us human evolved during the Stone Age, when humans lived predominantly as nomadic hunter-gatherers.\nDiseases of civilization may therefore be a consequence of mismatch between traits evolved in another environmental context and the environment we are currently experiencing. Traits that were previously adaptive or selectively neutral may suddenly have a negative impact on health and, ultimately, fitness. For example, an apatite for fatty and sugary foods and alcohol may have been adaptive or selectively neutral when these resources were scarce and periodic starvation was common. However, in an age where these goods are perpetually available—thanks to cooperate lobbying and governmental regulation, often at a lower prices than healthier options—excessive intake can lead to obesity, diabetes, and substance abuse, with all of their associated health issues.\nIn other cases, diseases of civilization may be a consequence of hidden phenotypic variation, uncovered when development is impacted by novel environmental conditions or habits (i.e., phenotypic plasticity in response to novel environmental cues not present before). For example, myopia (nearsightedness) is rare in hunter-gatherer communities, but 22 % of humans worldwide are myopic to a degree that they require glasses. The incidence of myopia has been drastically increasing since World War I (Figure @ref(fig:myopia)A) and coincided with the introduction for formalized schooling in many countries. Comparison of the frequency of myopia across countries with different education systems still reveals substantial differences in the prevalence of myopia today (Figure @ref(fig:myopia)B).\nIt turns out that the increase in myopia prevalence was an inadvertent consequence of school work that emphasizes near-field visual work, like reading books and working on computer monitors. The visual experience during development influences the growth of the eye, and extensive near-field work ultimately impacts far-field vision. It is important to note that there is also a heritable component to myopia, and people vary in the degree to which they are susceptible to development of myopia (i.e., there is genetic variation for plasticity in this trait). Essentially, the alleles that control the propensity of an individual to develop myopia in response to near-field visual work were selectively neutral in the past, when such work was comparatively rare. With the change of schooling and workplace practices, however, that hidden propensity to change eye growth in response to an environmental cue became not only visible, but led to suboptimal trait expression that was not previously tested by natural selection. The availability of mitigating measures (glasses, contact lenses, laser surgeries) indicate that alleles increasing susceptibility to myopia will likely remain in human populations at a high frequency.\n\n\n\n\n\nA. Prevalence of myopia from 1938 to 2013 for four Asian countries. Data from Morgan et al. (2018). A. Prevalence of myopia for countries with different education systems. Data from Morgan et al. (2018).\n\n\n\n\nDiseases of civilization may be prevalent in modern societies because not enough time has passed to match our bodies to our novel lifestyles. In other words, diseases of civilization are a symptom of a lack of adaptation; as a population, we have not yet evolved the defenses necessary to fend off many perils of modern life (e.g., sedentary lifestyles and high-calorie diets). Studying diseases of civilization from an evolutionary perspective allows us to better understand why their prevalence is so high. While these insights may not be as important for developing treatments for such diseases (that is explored by biomedical research, which illuminates the proximate causes of disease), understanding the ultimate causes behind disease development is critical for disease prevention. Understanding how our traits from ancient times respond to the novel environmental conditions that we have created for ourselves is key to preventative healthcare that evaluates how environmental factors and lifestyle choices affect disease risk.\n\n\n23.2.3 An Example: Breast Cancer\nOne of the most common types of cancer is breast cancer. In the U.S. alone, there are over 284,000 new cases and over 44,000 deaths every single year, primarily in women. I want to use breast cancer as a case study to explore how evolutionary perspectives might inform our understanding and the prevention of a disease, as breast cancer has a number of risk factors that relate to evolutionary genetics and diseases of civilization.\nResearch has indicated that genetic predisposition plays a role in the development of some breast cancers. Particularly, mutations in the BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes—two tumor suppressor genes—have been associated with an elevated risk for breast cancer in women. While only 5-10 % of breast cancers are associated with BRCA mutations, 40-65 % of women with a BRCA mutations are treated for breast cancer within their lifetime. As a consequence, only 59 % of women with a BRCA1 mutation and 71 % of women with a BRCA2 mutation reach an age of 70 (compared 84 % of women without this mutation). Hence, selection against mutations in BRAC genes should be strong, and deleterious alleles should be accordingly rare. Population genetic analyses, however, have indicated that 1 in 381 women (0.26%) carries a BRAC1 mutation and 1 in 277 (0.36%) a BRAC 2 mutation, and these allele frequencies are much higher than expected considering the high incidence of disease. Interestingly, at least BRAC1 appears to be under positive selection in humans and chimpanzees, suggesting that natural selection acts to promote alternative genetic variants at that locus rather than removing them (Huttley et al. 2000). Cochran and colleagues (2006) proposed that mutations in BRAC1 stimulate neural growth and might be linked to higher cognitive abilities, providing fitness benefits that balance costs associated with cancer development. However, rigorous tests of this hypothesis are still lacking.\nBesides genetic factors, environmental and lifestyle factors also affect breast cancer risk. Early work attempting to explain the high frequency of breast cancer focused on the hypothesis that this type of cancer was caused by a pathogen. In mice, tumors in the mammary glands are frequently associated with a viral infection (mouse mammary tumor virus, MMTV), and researchers have hypothesized that MMTV or MMTV-like viruses could also be responsible for causing tumors in women. This hypothesis was supported by two primary findings: (1) Some cells isolated from human breast cancers indeed exhibited DNA sequences which resembled MMTV. (2) Breast cancer rates in Europe appeared to be correlated with the presence of different species of mice, Mus domesticus, which occurs in western Europe, and M. musculus, which occurs in eastern Europe. MMTV frequencies differ significantly between the two species and are much higher in M. domesticus. Intriguingly, breast cancer rates in women are higher in countries with M. domesticus than in countries with M. musculus, with countries in the hybrid zone between the two species being intermediate (Figure @ref(fig:bcancer)A). Some researchers have taken this as evidence for a causal link between MMTV and human breast cancers, even though no MMTV particles have ever been found in human cancer samples. Correlation, in this case, may consequently not be causation. If you consider the distributional border that separates the two species (it runs through Germany, south through the Balkans), it does not take a whole lot of detective work to come up with a tangible list of confounding variables that might also impact breast cancer risk. The distribution of the two mouse species is actually paralleled by major socioeconomic differences between countries in western and eastern Europe, which arose as a consequence of the Iron Curtain that separated the Soviet block from the West and its allied states. For over 50 years, lifestyles across the divided Europe were drastically different.\nThe question then becomes: what are the lifestyle changes that potentially impact breast cancer risks? Besides obesity and substance abuse, changes in family planning and reproductive medicine have been associated with the development of breast cancers. Women in the western world, on average, have relatively few children, and many use hormonal birth control that strictly manages menstrual cycling. Most women in our society have 9-12 menstrual cycles per year until they reach menopause. This high rate of cycling, however, seems to be a relatively new phenomenon. In more traditional societies, where women bear more children and contraceptives are less common, menstrual cycles are much more irregular throughout women’s life. For example, pre-menopausal Dogon women from Mali on average have only three menstrual cycles over a period of two years (Figure @ref(fig:bcancer)B), which is about 85 % less than women in our society. The reduced number of menstrual cycles in Dogon women is not associated with a later onset of menarche or an early onset of menopause, but with a lower frequency of cycles—especially in women aged 20-34 (Figure @ref(fig:bcancer)C). Women of that age have a reduced number of cycles because they are either pregnant or are going through amenorrhea associated with lactation.\nSo, what might be the causal relationship between menstrual cycling and breast cancer? Pulses of estrogen and progesterone in the post-ovulatory phase of the menstrual cycle stimulate the proliferation of breast tissues, leading to the cyclical changes in breast size and shape experienced by many women. Signals for cell proliferation, however, are not only received by healthy breast cells, but also cells that exhibit somatic mutations and are potential precursors to tumors. Hence, the higher frequency of menstrual cycles increases the number of growth signals potential cancer cells receive over the course of a woman’s life, and thus, the likelihood that malignant tumors eventually develop. The link between menstrual cycling and breast cancer risk is not only supported by comparisons of menstruation rates between cultures, but also within our own society. For example, late onset menarche and early onset menopause that reduce the number of lifetime menstrual cycles are also correlated with breast cancer risk (Figure @ref(fig:bcancer)D). Finally, breast cancer risk is not only associated with the number of hormone surges that coincide with menstrual cycling, but also with the strength of the hormone peak. For example, women in industrialized nations that have a comparatively high energy intake also exhibit higher progesterone concentrations during the post-ovulatory phase, which in turn are correlated with the incidence of breast cancers across countries (Figure @ref(fig:bcancer)E).\nThe high rate of breast cancer in our society is therefore at least in part a consequence of changed habits in reproduction and family planning. An inadvertent consequence of a reduced number of pregnancies and hormonal birth control is the increase in growth stimuli received by cancer precursors after every ovulation. Pharmaceutical research has consequently started to develop methods of hormonal birth control that reduce the number cycles each year to 1-4 (e.g., Seaonale, Quartette, and Amethyst). Ironically, these drugs were—and still are—catching on slowly, because monthly menstrual cycling is perceived as natural and reduced cycling as artificial, and thus, perhaps unhealthy. As a consequence, extended-use birth control drugs are typically advertised for the convenience they provide and not for the potential health benefits.\n\n\n\n\n\nA.

    "section": "23.3 Why We Age… and Die",
    "text": "23.3 Why We Age… and Die\nThe inevitability of aging and death is an intriguing biological paradox that warrants closer examination from an evolutionary perspective. Both scientists and science fiction writers have been obsessed with the fountain of youth and the secret to eternal life—without much success. So why is it that we age and ultimately die? Why hasn’t natural selection favored alleles that prolong survival extensively—or even eternally—to allow for many bouts of reproduction? After all, it seems like an immortal variant would have a fitness advantage over any variant that succumbs to an early death. When pondering why we age and die, Nobel laureate Francis Jacob said it most elegantly in 1982 :\n\n“It is truly amazing that a complex organism, formed through an extraordinarily intricate process of morphogenesis, should be unable to perform the much simpler task of merely maintaining what already exists.”\nFrancis Jacob, 1982\n\nThe inability of organisms to maintain their bodies is the ultimate cause of aging (also known as senescence): a decline in survivability and reproductive capacity with increasing age. Aging is almost universal in multicellular organisms and even present in some microbes, where asymmetric cell divisions leave behind larger mother cells with reduced viability. Only a few organisms that appear to defy age-related deterioration have been found so far, and they include some flatworms (Platyhelminthes) and small cnidarians (Hydra) with asexual reproduction.\n\n23.3.1 Rate of Living Hypothesis\nOne hypothesis as to why natural selection has not favored alleles for longer lifespans (or even eternal life) is that it simply can’t. Perhaps natural selection has already pushed the lifespan to the maximum , such that the maximum lifespans observed in different species today are bound by intrinsic constraints that are impossible for natural selection to overcome. The rate of living hypothesis posits that ageing is an inadvertent byproduct of metabolic activity. As cells live and proliferate, they continue to accrue irreparable damage to the point that sustaining proper function is impossible.\nThe rate of living hypothesis makes two testable predictions: (1) The rate of aging in different species should be correlated with the pace of life. Organisms that have a very fast mass-specific metabolism (e.g., bats and hummingbirds) should age comparatively fast and accordingly have short lifespans, while aging in those with slow mass-specific metabolism (e.g., sloths and some deep-sea animals) should age much slower and have longer lifespans. (2) Because organisms have already been selected to resist and repair damage at their maximum capacity and lifespan is constrained by other factors, species should not be able to evolve longer lifespans.\n\nPrediction 1: Metabolism and Aging\nIf aging was an inadvertent consequence of metabolic activity, we would expect clear correlations between mass-specific energy expenditure (i.e., metabolic rate) and lifespan. Some organisms should live fast and die young, while others live more slowly and die old. A wide variety of approaches have been used to test this prediction. For example, if the rate of living theory were true, all organisms should have roughly the same lifetime energy expenditure—but it turns out lifetime energy expenditure varies drastically, even among species of mammals. More direct tests have looked at correlations between metabolic rate and lifespan, and again support for the hypothesis is mixed at best. While there is a negative correlation between energy expenditure and lifespan among mammals, the same correlation is absent among birds (Figure @ref(fig:ltee)A-B). More over, intraspecific variation in metabolism of mice was positively correlated with lifespan; mice with higher metabolic activity actually lived longer than those with lower metabolic activity (Figure @ref(fig:ltee)C), a pattern opposite of that predicted by the rate of living hypothesis. Consequently, neither patterns of lifetime energy expenditure nor correlations between energy expenditure and lifespan support the idea that there are internal constrains associated with metabolism to explain why organisms age.\n\n\n\n\n\nA. Relationship between daily energy expenditure and life span across different species of birds. The two variables are not significantly correlated. Data from Speakman (2005). B. Relationship between daily energy expenditure and life span across different species of mammals There is a weak negative correlation between the two variables. Data from Speakman (2005). C. Intraspecific variation of metabolic intensity in laboratory mice is positively correlated with lifespan, opposite of what is predicted by the rate of living hypothesis. Data from Speakman et al. (2002).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrediction 2: Selection on Life Span\nIf intrinsic constraints prevented natural selection from favoring longer lifespan, selection on lifespan should have no evolutionary effects. To test this hypothesis, researchers have used a number of selection experiments where they control when organisms reproduce. For example, selection experiments using Drosophila melanogaster continuously propagated offspring that were produced by young adults (early reproducing) or by older individuals that were towards the maximum lifespan (late reproducing). Contrary to the prediction of the rate of living hypothesis, the longevity of flies in the late-reproducing selection lines increased substantially from around 35 to almost 70 days, a 100 % increase, in just 20 generations (Figure @ref(fig:sellong)A). Reversal of selection in generation 19 also lead to a decrease of longevity, indicating that lifespan can evolve rapidly in either direction (gray line in Figure @ref(fig:sellong)A). The evolution of longer lifespans would be consistent with the rate of living hypothesis if flies that evolved a longer lifespan also evolved lower metabolic rates. While flies with postponed senescence indeed have a lower metabolic rate compared to control flies in the first two weeks of their lives, these differences disappear later in life (Figure @ref(fig:sellong)B), and the overall magnitude of difference in metabolic rate is not sufficient to explain observed differences in longevity.\n\n\n\n\n\nA. Evolution of lifespan in selection lines that either reproduce early or late in life. Not the increase in lifespan especially in late-reproducing flies and the decrease in lifespan once selection in reversed. Data form Luckinbill and Clare (1985). B. The evolution of increased lifespan leads to a decrease of metabolic rates, but only in the first two weeks of a fly’s life. Data form Service (1987).\n\n\n\n\nWhile the rate of living hypothesis and related ideas (e.g., genomic instability, telomere attrition, and epigenetic alterations) have stimulated diverse research projects about why we age and uncovered important proximate mechanisms of aging, the central premises of these ideas do not hold up to scrutiny. There does not appear to be a universal intrinsic constraint that limits how long cells or organisms can live, and lifespan can clearly evolve in either direction when selection is applied. So, if longer lifespans are technically possible, why is it that they do not evolve?\n\n\n\n23.3.2 Evolutionary Theories of Aging\nEvolutionary explanations for aging focus less on the inability of organisms to repair damage that accrues from metabolic activity, and more on the costs and benefits associated with a failure to repair damage as it arises. As in the rate of living hypothesis, aging from an evolutionary perspective is a consequence of gradual decay—but early death does not necessarily translate to lower fitness. To examine the relationship between aging and fitness, we will focus on two non-mutually exclusive hypotheses: (1) The mutation accumulation hypothesis posits that the costs associated with a failure to repair damage and the resulting aging are minimal. (2) The antagonistic pleitropy hypothesis proposes that there may even be benefits associated with with a failure to repair damage and the resulting aging.\n\nMutation-Accumulation Hypothesis\nThe mutation-accumulation hypothesis explains aging through a decline in the effectiveness of selection as organisms age. The older an individual is, the lower its chances are to produce future offspring (this future reproductive potential is also called the residual reproductive value). Hence, the residual reproductive value declines as a function of age. If a deleterious mutation arises that causes a loss of function early in life, the mutation is strongly selected against, because the residual reproductive value for young individuals is high and the fitness consequences of an early-acting loss of function mutation are accordingly high. However, if a deleterious mutation causes a similar loss of function much later in life, the fitness costs are much lower because the residual reproductive value is also lower. In other words, if a deleterious mutation unfolds its effects late it life, that mutation will already have been passed on to the next generation before the carrier ever experiences the detrimental effects. The detrimental effects are simply not visible to natural selection until it is too late and the deleterious alleles have already been inherited by individuals of the next generation. Consequently, deleterious mutations that unfold their effects late in life can accumulate in a population over time because selection against those mutations is weak.\nExperiments have shown that deleterious mutations behind aging can indeed accumulate in populations. For example, Reed and Bryant (2000) studied large and small populations of houseflies (Musca domestica). Normally, male houseflies live for about 28 days and females for about 36 days, but the researchers only allowed the flies to reproduce for four or five days after they reached sexual maturity. Hence, any deleterious mutations that unfolded their effects after day five of a fly’s adult life had suddenly become selectively neutral. After 24 generations of reproduction limited to early adults, the lifespan of flies significantly declined to just 25 days (13 % decline) in males and about 30 days (18 % decline) in females—irrespective of population size (Figure @ref(fig:delmu)A). This decline in lifespan is a direct consequence of selection’s inability to remove deleterious mutations with late-acting fitness effects from the population. Hence, more rapid aging, in this case, has evolved simply because there were no substantial fitness costs to dying early.\nEvidence for mutation accumulation as a cause for aging also comes from natural systems. For example, annual killifish (Nothobranchidae) live in temporary waters associated with African savannas. In this ecosystem, pools fill up during the rainy season but dry out rapidly once the rains stop. Annual killifish are able to survive in these habitats because they have desiccation-resistant eggs that remain dormant during the dry season. Once the rainy season starts, the offspring hatch, rapidly grow to adulthood, spawn to produce the eggs for the next generation, and then die as the water evaporates around them. As a consequence of the temporally limited availability of their habitat, annual killifishes have evolved some of the shortest lifespans of any vertebrates; even under ideal laboratory conditions, these fish only live for 3-12 months, which is much shorter than related species of killifish that live in permanent water bodies. A recent study compared the evolution of genomes in two clades of annual killifishes (genera Callopanchax and Nothobranchius) as well as sister genera of non-annual killifish that live in permanent waters of western Africa (Scriptaphyosemion and Aphyosemion) (Cui et al. 2019). The researchers were particularly interested in whether they might be able to detect evidence for relaxed selection in annual killifish genomes that might be indicative of mutation accumulation. Indeed, annual killifish have much larger portions of the genome associated with relaxed selection compared to closely related species from permanent habitats, which also have longer lifespans (Figure @ref(fig:delmu)B). The pronounced signatures of relaxed selection indicate that mutations with effects only after the habitats dry up and the fish die anyways have become selectively neutral and are retained in the annual species, while they are purged by purifying selection in the non-annual species.\nFinally, humans also offer circumstantial evidence for the accumulation of deleterious effects with late life impacts. Many late-onset genetic diseases are consistent with this hypothesis. For example, hereditary nonpolyposis colon cancer is caused by mutations in DNA repair genes. The median age of diagnosis for this type of cancer is 48 years. So most patients do not see the deleterious effects of such mutations until after the age at which reproduction begins—and in many cases has already ended. Other cancers, as well as Huntington’s disease, have also been proposed to be manifestations of aging caused by late-acting deleterious mutations.\n\n\n\n\n\nA. Evolution of lifespan in houseflies (Musca domestica) whose reproductive was limited to the first five days of their lives. Since deleterious mutations that unfold their effect after the reproductive period become selectively neutral, lifespan decreases as a consequence of the accumulation of deleterious mutations in the populations. Data form Reed and Bryant (2000). B. Patterns of genome evolution in annual killifishes and their non-annual relatives. Annual killifish exhibit much stronger signatures of relaxed selection characteristic for mutation accumulation. Note that clade 1 consists of Callopanchax (annual) and Scriotaphyosemion (non-annual); clade 2 of Nothobranchius (annual) and Aphyosemion (non-annual). Data form Cui et al. (2019).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAntagonistic-Pleiotropy Hypothesis\nThe antagonistic-pleiotropy hypothesis explains aging as a consequence of pleiotropic effects that increase reproduction early in life and reduce survivability later in life. Because natural selection weakens as the residual reproductive value decreases, alleles that cause early maturation or elevated reproductive output are favored—even if they simultaneously have deleterious effects later on. For example, a mutant allele might change the way organisms allocate energy to growth, maintenance, and reproduction. If energy is invested disproportionally into the production of offspring early in life, detrimental effects associated with a lack of investment into maintenance and repair can cause individuals to suffer from an earlier decline in function and increased mortality. In this case, aging might evolve not only due to low costs associated with late-acting mutations, but also because the costs are outweighed by fitness benefits early in life.\nExperiments with Drosophila and other model organisms provide evidence for the role of antagonistic pleiotropy in the evolution of aging. For example, Zwaan et al. (1995) established different lines of D. melanogaster that were either selected for short or for long lifespans. Similar to the experiment described in Figure @ref(fig:sellong)A), both selection regimes caused lifespans to evolve in the predicted direction; they got shorter relative to the control in one treatment and longer relative to the control in the other (Figure @ref(fig:antpleim)A). However, the change in lifespan did not occur in isolation. Particularly, the evolution of longer lifespans was accompanied by a severe reduction of fecundity (Figure @ref(fig:antpleim)A), indicating that there is a cost to longevity, as predicted by the antagonistic-pleiotropy hypothesis. Competition experiments using flies with different lifespans have indicated that living longer is not necessarily beneficial, if long-living flies are out-reproduced by flies that might die earlier. This is an important reminder that fitness is not just a function of survival. In fact, a mutation conferring eternal life will always be selected against if it also reduces lifetime reproductive output to the extent that the contribution of a carrier to the next generation’s gene pool is diminished.\nWhile the general evidence for antagonistic pleiotropy’s role in the evolution of aging is mounting, evidence from humans remains scant. One possible candidate for antagonistic pleiotropy is hereditary haemochromatosis, an autosomal recessive disorder associated with iron uptake. While young individuals benefit from enhanced dietary iron absorption in terms of immune function, older individuals face costs associated with raised iron loads, which can cause cardiomyopathy and neurodegenerative diseases later in life (Rodríguez et al 2017). In addition, recent results from genome-wide association studies on diseases that appear at different periods in life also indicated that pleiotropic effects associated with aging may be common in the human genome (Rodríguez et al 2017).\n\n\n\n\n\nA. Selection of either short or long lifespan in D. melanogaster causes clear evolutionary responses in longevity. Data form Zwaan et al. (1995). B. Evolution of longer lifespans coincides with drastic reductions in fecundity, indicating antaginistic pleiotropic effects. Data form Zwaan et al. (1995).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEcology and the Evolution of Aging\nMutation accumulation and antagonistic pleiotropy can explain why nearly all organisms age. The core insight is that long life—perhaps contrary to our intuition—is not as important to fitness as making a substantial contribution to the gene pool of the next generation. However, these two hypotheses alone cannot explain why annual killifish die after just 3 months, but greenland sharks live up to 400 years. Clearly, investing into growth and maintenance is actually beneficial under some circumstances. So, what factors determine whether a “live fast and die young” or a “live slow and die old” strategy prevails?\nOne of the key determinants shaping the evolution of aging is the rate of extrinsic mortality; i.e., the likelihood that external factors like predation, disease, resource limitation, or exposure to environmental stress kill an organism. If the rate of extrinsic mortality is very high and individuals are unlikely to survive for long periods of time, there is little use in investing energy into maintenance and growth. Energy, in such a case, is best invested into reproduction while still alive. The annual killifishes discussed above are a perfect example. All members of the species will invariably die when their habitats dry at the onset of the dry season. Therefore, the best life history strategy is to grow fast and reproduce as much as possible before it is too late. Investment into repairing cellular damage that has accrued as a consequence of metabolic activity is simply not a priority when your habitat all but vanishes. In contrast, for species with a low rate of extrinsic mortality, fitness may be maximized by growing for a longer period of time, because larger bodies are associated with increasedcompetitiveness and higher fecundity.\nEvidence for the role of extrinsic mortality in aging can also be found in other study systems. For example, Shattuck and Williams (2010) compared the lifespan of arboreal and terrestrial mammals. Lifespan was positively correlated with body size, and arboreal species that are exposed to fewer predators exhibited significantly higher longevity than their terrestrial counterparts that are more vulnerable to predation (Figure @ref(fig:natage)A). Similarly, populations of the Virginia opossum (Didelphis virginiana) age differently depending on their risk of extrinsic mortality. On the mainland, where opossums face a number of predators, extrinsic mortality is high and cumulative survival reaches zero after less than 30 months (Figure @ref(fig:natage)B). In contrast, opossums on an island in the Gulf of Mexico, which is free of natural predators, have a much higher life expectancy (Figure @ref(fig:natage)B). Accordingly, mainland and island opossums age differently and differentially allocate resources to maintenance and reproduction. Female opossums on the mainland make a substantial investment into reproduction in their first year after reaching maturity, but their investment declines in the second year—if they are still alive (Figure @ref(fig:natage)C). This decline in investment is a consequence of aging and in stark contrast with reproductive investments on the island, where females are able to invest equally into their offspring in year 1 and year 2 of reproduction. Differences in the decline of physiological performance between populations also provides evidence for more rapid aging in mainland opossums.\nAlong with extrinsic mortality, selection on other life history traits can also affect the evolution of aging in natural populations. For example, selection on body size, offspring number and size, and reproductive intervals may all have inadvertent consequences on the frequency of alleles that affect aging, whether it is through mutation accumulation or antagonistic pleiotropy. Ultimately, the optimal strategy in any ecological context is shaped by trade-offs in how limited time and energy are allocated to different needs (i.e., growth, maintenance, repair, and reproduction).\n\n\n\n\n\nA.

    "text": "25 Evolutionary Medicine II: Evolving Pathogens\nIn the previous chapter, we focused on understanding non-communicable diseases from an evolutionary perspective. We will now focus on infectious diseases caused by evolving pathogens. In Chapter 7, we already explored the evolutionary relationship between pathogens and their hosts. We learned how hosts evolve strategies to exclude or combat pathogens, while pathogens are selected to evade the hosts’ defense mechanisms—giving rise to a continuous coevolutionary arms race. Pathogens, of course, have the upper hand in this evolutionary game, since their large population sizes and short generation times allow them to evolve much more rapidly than their hosts—especially in long-lived species like humans. But from a personal and public health perspective, we can’t just stand idly by as pathogens exert selection on our population, watching the cost of selection (e.g., the death toll caused by disease) rise and hoping that the next generation will be better adapted to recurring waves of infection. We cannot evolve our way out of a contagious disease problem. However, as a society, we collectively have the power to impact a pathogen’s fitness and steer its evolution towards more desirable health outcomes for us. In this chapter, we will explore how evolutionary principles relate to epidemiology, and how cultural practices can critically shape the dynamics of disease spread and the evolution of pathogen properties—including antibiotic resistance in harmful bacteria.",

    "section": "25.1 Epidemiology and Pathogen Fitness",
    "text": "25.1 Epidemiology and Pathogen Fitness\nA pathogen’s fitness is directly related to its ability to spread in a population of hosts. Epidemiologists have developed sophisticated models to better understand how diseases spread, how many people will be infected, or how long a disease outbreak might last. Let’s take a look at one such epidemiological model (the SEIR model) to familiarize ourselves with the general logic epidemiologists apply, and then relate this logic to explicitly define pathogen fitness.\n\n25.1.1 A Basic Epidemiological model\nThere are a number of theoretical models epidemiologists apply to study disease dynamics. Many of them are compartmental models, where individuals in a populations are assigned to different compartments (categorical groups), and we quantify the rates at which individuals transition from one compartment to another. For example, in the SEIR model, a population is subdivided into four compartments (Figure @ref(fig:seir)): (1) susceptible hosts (S) that are available for a pathogen; (2) infected hosts (E) that have contracted a pathogen but cannot yet spread it (i.e., they are within an incubation period); (3) infectious hosts (I) that show disease symptoms and can pass on the pathogen to susceptible individuals in the population; and (4) recovered hosts (R) that have cleared the infection and are now immune to the pathogen.\nThe pool of total hosts in the population (N=S+E+I+R) depends on the rate at which new individuals are born (birth rate, 𝝻) and the rate at which individuals die (death rate, 𝝳; Figure @ref(fig:seir)). If we assume a constant population size, the birth and death rates cancel each other out; hence, we will ignore them in our considerations. From the perspective of disease dynamics, it is more important at what rates individuals transition from one epidemiological compartment to another:\n\nThe rate at which susceptible individuals become infected depends on the density of susceptible individuals, the density of infectious individuals, and the rate of disease transmission (𝝱). The transmission rate is a property of the pathogen (some pathogens are more easily transmitted than others), as well as the host’s behavior and cultural practices.\nOnce infected, the rate at which individuals become infectious depends on the incubation rate (𝝹), which is largely a property of the pathogen. Some pathogens replicate rapidly within a newly infected host (e.g., noroviruses can cause diarrhea within 12-24 hours post-infection), while others lie dormant for extended periods of time before becoming active (e.g., infections with Plasmodium vivax, Listeria monocytogenes, and Molluscum contagiosum can take months to unfold).\nOnce infectious, individuals have two possible fates. They may be able to clear the infection and recover at a rate of 𝝼. Recovered individuals are unavailable to the pathogen due to acquired immunity, unless they lose that immunity (at the rate of 𝝺). Alternatively, infectious individuals may die as a direct consequence of the pathogen’s activity within the body. The infectious mortality rate is the pathogen’s virulence (𝝰), which is a measure of host damage stemming from interactions between hosts and pathogens.\n\nFrom a pathogen’s perspective, epidemiology is all about balancing the rates at which new hosts can be infected and the rates at which hosts become unavailable, either due to death or immunity. Pathogens are, of course, keen to tip the balance in favor of transmission, which allows their spread in a population.\n\n\n\n\n\nGraphic representation of the SEIR model (see text for details).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n25.1.2 R0: A Measure of Pathogen Fitness\nThe basic reproductive number (R0) is the expected number of secondary cases generated by a single infectious individual entering a population composed of entirely susceptible individuals. Hence, R0 estimates the epidemic growth at the start of an outbreak. Imagine a traveler coming back from an exotic destination where they contracted a new kind of infectious disease; if R0=2, that traveler—patient zero—is expected to infect two other people after their return, and if R0=6, six other people would be infected. As you can see in Table 13.1, basic reproductive numbers vary vastly among different pathogens that cause health issues in human populations. R0 can also vary within a pathogen depending on the epidemiological context.\n\nTable 13.1: Approximate basic reproductive numbers for different pathogens that routinely infect humans.\n\n\nDisease\nR0\n\n\n\n\nHepatitis C\n2\n\n\nEbola\n2\n\n\nZika\n2\n\n\nSpanish flu\n4\n\n\nHIV\n4\n\n\nSARS (2002 outbreak)\n4\n\n\nSmallpox\n6\n\n\nRubella\n6\n\n\nMumps\n10\n\n\nChickenpox\n11\n\n\nMeasles\n18\n\n\n\nThe basic reproductive number is a measure of a pathogen’s fitness. Just as natural selection acts to maximize the fitness of individuals, it also acts to maximize the basic reproductive number of pathogens. If R0&gt;1, a pathogen can spread in a population of hosts, and it can spread faster with increasing values of R0. If R0&lt;1, then the rate of spread is not fast enough to remain in the population, and the disease will disappear. If R0=1, then the frequency of the pathogen remains stable through time.\nImportantly, we can link analyses of pathogen evolution to epidemiological analyses, because the basic reproductive number can be approximated using epidemiological parameters that describe the transition rates of individuals across different epidemiological classes (S to E to I to R). Assuming that birth and pathogen-independent mortality rates are the same, incubation periods are short, and loss of immunity is rare, then the basic reproductive number can be defined as:\n\\[\\begin{align}\nR_0=\\frac{βS}{⍺+ν} (\\#eq:47)\n\\end{align}\\]\nIn this case, 𝝱 is the transmission rate, S is the density of susceptible individuals in the population, 𝝰 is the pathogen’s virulence, and 𝝼 is the rate of recovery. To put the formula into words: pathogen fitness is positively influenced by high transmission rates and high densities of susceptible individuals, and it is negatively influenced by high rates of recovery (which converts susceptible individuals to immune individuals) and by high rates of pathogen-induced mortality.\nWe can examine the basic reproductive numbers that have been reported for different pathogens during past outbreaks. Measles stands out because it has a very high R0. This high value is driven primarily by measles’ high transmission rate (𝝱). The measles virus (Measles morbillivirus) is transmitted when infectious individuals cough or sneeze, contaminating the air and surfaces with virus particles. The virus stays alive outside the host body for several hours, and anyone breathing in contaminated air or touching contaminated surfaces has a 90 % change of becoming infected. In addition, infectious individuals can spread this virus up to four days before any symptoms arise; so by the time patients realize that they are sick, they have likely already spread to virus to other hosts. This extremely efficient transmission corresponds to a high value of R0.\nIn contrast, Ebola—though it seems like a scarier disease based on news coverage—has a much smaller basic reproductive number. The Ebola virus (Zaire ebolavirus) can only be spread by direct contact with blood or other bodily fluids of an infectious individual, which translates to much lower transmission rates. In addition, the high rate at which Ebola causes the death of infectious individuals further decreases the probability of its spread, because it narrows the window during which the pathogen can jump to the next host. Hence, Ebola disease spread is often self-limiting, which explains why outbreaks tend to be spatially restricted.",

    "section": "25.2 The Evolution of Virulence",
    "text": "25.2 The Evolution of Virulence\nOne of the key factors in pathogen evolution is virulence. Unlike transmissibility, which is often subject to a variety of constraints, virulence can evolve rapidly, with concomitant consequences for disease dynamics. A common misconception is that pathogens will eventually evolve toward low virulence, resulting in a commensal relationship between host and pathogen. When first proposed, the rationale behind this idea appeared to be supported by both theoretical considerations and empirical observations.\nEarly theoreticians suggested that high virulence decreases pathogen fitness (R0), and a minimally impacted host is ideal for carrying the pathogen around and facilitating its spread. This notion was supported by the observation that novel hosts often have a higher susceptibility to a pathogen when compared to hosts that experienced a coevolutionary history with the same pathogen. This difference suggested that coevolution between host and pathogen ultimately reduces virulence. For example, smallpox and other diseases common in European populations caused high rates of mortality in Native American peoples that did not have previous contact to these pathogens. This difference in disease susceptibility was ruthlessly exploited by British colonialists and—allegedly—by the U.S. Army, who distributed smallpox-infested blankets as a form of biological warfare to eradicate Native peoples. However, there are also prominent counterexamples, such as diseases like malaria and tuberculosis, which have long-documented histories of coevolution with humans yet still exhibit high virulence.\nToday, we know that coevolution does not necessarily lead to pathogens with a low virulence, and, in some cases, high virulence is adaptive for the pathogen. There are three, non-mutually exclusive hypotheses that explain the maintenance of intermediate or high virulence: the trade-off hypothesis, the short-sighted evolution hypothesis, and the coincidental evolution hypothesis.\n\n25.2.1 Trade-Offs and Modes of Transmission\nVirulence, the damage a pathogen causes hosts, is a byproduct of pathogen replication. Pathogens produce antigens and metabolic byproducts while using the host’s tissues, nutrients, and energetic resources, which collectively impair host function and fitness. The more rapidly pathogens replicate within a host, the higher the cost imposed on the host. A trade-off arises, because a pathogen’s fitness improves with increasing reproductive capacity (more infectious particles are produced to infect new hosts), but pathogen fitness is also impaired by the correlated virulence, which reduces the host’s ability to facilitate transmission. Consequently, the optimal virulence is somewhere at an intermediate level; high enough to support sufficient pathogen replication but low enough to limit damage to the host, such that transmission to new hosts can still occur. The exact balance in this trade-off is partly shaped by how pathogens are transmitted from one host to another.\nTo explore how modes of transmission can impact the trade-off between virulence and transmission, let’s contrast two basic modes of transmission. Horizontal transmission occurs when pathogens are transmitted among individuals of the same generation, while vertical transmission occurs from mothers to offspring. If transmission is exclusively vertical, then the fitness of the pathogen becomes inextricably linked to the fitness of the host; any virulence that damages the host will also damage pathogen. Therefore, the costs associated with elevated virulence should decrease with increasing opportunities for horizontal transmission.\nSharon Messenger and her coauthors (1999) tested this prediction using Escherichia coli bacteria as host cells and a bacteriophage (i.e., a virus that infects bacteria) as a pathogen. In this system, they were able to tightly control the mode of transmission (vertical vs. horizontal), and the researchers alternated periods of vertical transmission (for either one or eight days) with short bouts of horizontal transmission. They predicted that shorter periods of vertical transmission should select for higher rates of pathogen replication, and accordingly, higher virulence. The results of this evolution experiment not only revealed the expected correlation between virulence and pathogen reproduction, but also the expected virulence difference between treatments that differed in the amount of horizontal transmission (Figure @ref(fig:veritcaltrans)A). When vertical transmission was limited, it was advantageous for phages to replicate quickly—both because increased production of virus particles facilitated horizontal transmission and because costs associated with damage to the host were relatively small (the fate of the host was decoupled from the fate of the pathogen after just one day). In contrast, phages were able to maximize their fitness by minimizing damage to the host when there were long periods of vertical transfer, because phage fitness was contingent on host fitness during that period.\nNatural systems also illustrate the importance of vertical transmission in shaping virulence evolution. Fig wasps are tiny hymenopterans that pollinate figs and are parasitized by nematodes. Fig wasps deposit their eggs inside of figs, where most of the wasps’ life cycle takes place: larvae develop, pupate, emerge as adults, and mate inside the fig, and females then disperse out to lay their eggs on a new fruit. Different species of fig wasps vary in their mating systems. In some species, only a single female deposits eggs on a fig, such that the resulting matings in the next generation are primarily between brothers and sisters. In other species, multiple females lay eggs on the same fig. The different behaviors have direct consequences for the transmission of the fig wasps’ nematode parasites. In wasp species where only one female lays her eggs on a particular fig, there are no opportunities for horizontal transmission, and nematodes are exclusively transmitted vertically. Since the nematodes’ fitness is thus linked to the wasps’ fitness, we would predict that the parasites have evolved a relatively low virulence. In contrast, nematodes should evolve higher virulence in wasp species where multiple females lay eggs on the same fig, facilitating horizontal parasite transmission. Indeed, there was a negative correlation between the proportion of single foundress broods and the virulence of nematode parasites across different species of fig wasps (Figure @ref(fig:veritcaltrans)B). Overall, these two examples illustrate how natural selection can drive the evolution of low virulence when there are high costs associated with damaging the hosts, irrespective of the benefits to increased reproductive rates. The next question is: under what circumstances are costs associated with damaging the host less severe, such that higher virulence can evolve?\n\n\n\n\n\nA. Correlation between pathogen replication and virluence in phages that have frequent opportunities for horizontal transmission (i.e., every day; L1) and phages with few opportunities for horizontal transmission (i.e., every eight days; L8). As predicted by the trade-off hypothesis, virulence is lower in strains with higher levels of vertical transmission. Data from Messenger et al. (1999). B. Correlation between the proportion of single foundress broods (i.e., the degree of vertical transmission) and virulence in fig wasps and their nematode parasites. Data from Herre (1993).\n\n\n\n\nThe cost of virulence can be reduced—and even mostly avoided—if a pathogen is not reliant on the host for transmission. Consider the common cold, which is caused by a variety of rhinoviruses, coronaviruses, adenoviruses, and enteroviruses. All of these viruses have to be transmitted directly from one host to another, because they have a limited survivability outside of the host. Hence, a host that is too sick to move around and be in contact with susceptible individuals may clear an infection before significant opportunities for transmission arise. Hence, lower virulence facilitates transmission. However, there are two ways that a pathogen can circumnavigate costs associated with high virulence: a high pathogen survivability outside the host body and pathogen transmission through mobile vectors.\nIf a pathogen has a high survivability outside of the host’s body, it can linger in the environment and wait for a susceptible individual to pass by—even after the initial host has long perished. For example, anthrax bacteria (Bacillus anthracis) form resting spores that can survive in the soil for decades. Hence, a premature host death does not necessarily come at a substantial fitness cost for the pathogen, especially if high pathogen replication leads to the release of large numbers of propagules. Following the same logic, the virulence of intestinal bacteria that can cause disease is directly correlated with the proportion of outbreaks that are waterborne (i.e., transmitted through contaminated water; Figure @ref(fig:waterb)A). When sanitation is poor and contamination of drinking water common, host mobility becomes secondary to pathogen spread, and transmission is instead facilitated by high rates of pathogen replication with corresponding consequences for virulence.\nCosts associated with virulence can also be mitigated through vector-borne transmission, where an intermediate host carries and transmits a pathogen to a susceptible individual. Blood-feeding arthropods are particularly common disease vectors; they transmit many diseases relevant for human health. For example, mosquitoes are intermediate hosts for malaria, dengue, and zika, sand flies transmit leishmaniasis, hemipterans carry Chagas disease, and ticks spread Lyme disease, among many others. A comparison of virulence between diseases with different modes of transmission indicated that the vast majority of directly-transmitted pathogens have a very low virulence (&lt;0.1 % mortality per infection), while elevated and high virulence is much more common among vector-borne pathogens. Interestingly, the virulence of vector-borne pathogens inside the mobile vector that is responsible for disease transmission is often negligible, because the mobility of the intermediate host is critical for pathogen fitness.\nIn summary, trade-offs between pathogen reproduction and transmission explain the evolution of intermediate levels of virulence. Low virulence can evolve when decreases in host mobility and fitness also reduce pathogen transmission. However, if pathogens do not need “help” from their hosts to infect susceptible individuals, either because they can survive outside of the host or they can be transmitted by a vector, then there is little cost associated with killing the host, and high virulence may not be selected against.\n\n\n\n\n\nA. Virulence is higher in bacterial pathogens that are associated with frequent waterborne outbreaks. Data from Ewald (1991). B. Comparison of virulence between directly-transmitted and vectorborne pathogens. Data from Ewald (1983).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n25.2.2 Short-Sighted and Coincidental Evolution Hypotheses\nTwo additional hypotheses have been put forward to explain the evolution of high virulence in absence of trade-offs between pathogen replication and transmission.\nThe short-sighted evolution hypothesis emphasizes the fact that evolution and adaptation within the host might favor elevated virulence. For example, competition arising from co-infection of multiple pathogens can favor strains with more rapid replication, which has concomitant negative effects for the host. Rapid pathogen replication is favored, because the pathogen that uses host resources the fastest and successfully transmits to susceptible individuals will be able to persist in a population even when the host dies sooner than optimal for maximal transmission. In contrast, the slower-replicating pathogen may not be able to persist in that situation, because hosts may die (as a consequence of the faster-replicating pathogen) before the pathogen is transmitted. So, if there is within-host competition between pathogens, the cost of having a virulence that is too high tends to be smaller than the cost of having slower rates of replication. Evidence for a relationship between competitive ability and virulence comes from experiments with malaria (Plasmodium chabaudi). Especially during the acute phase of malaria, when the pathogen replicates quickly, strains with higher virulence have a competitive advantage over strains with lower virulence (Figure @ref(fig:malaria)). Other examples of short-sighted evolution have been inferred when pathogen strains escape competition by colonizing and adapting to novel tissues or organs within the host. For example, polio viruses typically infect the digestive tract, where they cause little harm to the host. Viral mutations that facilitate colonization of cells associated with the nervous system increase within-host fitness of the virus, even though infection of the nervous system does not lead to transmission to susceptible individuals. In this case, host fitness costs associated with viral replication in a novel cell type is just a byproduct of viral mutations that mediate increased within-host fitness, even if that adaptation is an evolutionary dead end for the pathogen.\n\n\n\n\n\nCorrelation between relative virulence and competitiveness for different strains of malaria (Plasmodium chabaudo) during acute and chronic phases of the disease. Relative virulence was quantified as the anemia induced by two competing strains when on their own, expressed as the anemia induced by least virulent competitor as a fraction of that induced by the more virulent. Thus, a value of 1.0 means the competing strains induce equal levels of anemia; a value of 0.5 that the less virulent clone induces half the anemia of the more virulent. Competitive suppression is the proportional reduction in strain density due to the presence of a competitor (1, competitive exclusion; 0, no suppression). Data from Bell et al. (2006).\n\n\n\n\nFinally, the coincidental evolution hypothesis posits that high virulence can evolve as an incidental byproduct of pathogen adaptation to other ecological niches. This hypothesis has been favored to explain virulence in facultative pathogens. For example, some soil microbes—like Clostridium tetani that causes tetanus—can be highly virulent if they happen to infect humans. Some researchers have suggested that the toxins produced by these bacteria have primarily evolved to deter grazing by protozoan predators in the soil. In humans, these anti-grazing defense toxins inadvertently interfere with normal physiological function and cause health issues, including death.",

    "text": "25.3 Cultural Practices, Disease Spread, and Evolution\nUnderstanding pathogen fitness and the principles governing the evolution of virulence from an epidemiological perspective offers key insights into how we can manage the spread and evolution of pathogens. In fact, evolutionary considerations inform public health guidelines that have profound impacts on disease dynamics—both when they are followed (disease outbreaks contract and low-virulence strains are favored) and when they are not (diseases spread and high-virulence strains can emerge). Thinking about pathogen fitness explicitly in the context of R0, we can manipulate two parameters in the equation through cultural practices: the rate of transmission (𝝱) and the density of susceptible individuals (S). If we take the reigns of a disease outbreak by tightly controlling rates of transmission or the density of susceptible individuals, then the pathogen has only one evolutionary strategy left to increase R0; it has to decrease its virulence (𝝰).\n\n25.3.1 Disrupting Pathogen Transmission\nIn many cases, the most cost-effective approach to reduce R0 is to minimize the rate of pathogen transmission. Prevention measures that reduce disease spread are, of course, largely dependent on the mode of transmission of the pathogen of concern. Most common pathogens we deal with on a regular basis—viruses that cause colds, the flu, and now COVID-19—are directly transmitted respiratory infections. Simple behavioral changes like increased personal hygiene, mask wearing, social distancing, and reduced travel, especially for people that are symptomatic, can dramatically reduce the spread of disease.\nEvidence for how effective these measures are was uncovered during the COVID-19 pandemic, when preventative measures that reduced transmission were much more rigorously enforced, including extended periods of lockdowns in some countries. While these measures primarily targeted the spread of SARS-CoV-2, the effectiveness of preventative measures is hard to gauge when looking at that virus, simply because comparative data from previous outbreaks is not available. However, the same preventative measures also affected the spread of other directly transmitted respiratory infections, including rhinoviruses that cause the common cold and influenza-A that causes the seasonal flu. In the wake of COVID-19-related lockdowns in 2020, infections of rhinoviruses were dramatically lower compared to the same time period in 2019 (Figure @ref(fig:rhinovirus)A). Infections drastically declined after the implementation of mandatory lockdowns, and they rose back to normal levels right after lockdowns ended later in the year. The same pattern holds true for influenza A. While there was an initial surge in late 2019, coinciding with the emergence of COVID-19, the frequency of positive flu tests plummeted to record lows by mid-2020 (Figure @ref(fig:rhinovirus)B). More importantly, the seasonal spike in flu cases that invariably occurs over the winter months completely disappeared in the winter of 2020/2021, with continued record-low test positivity rates. Consequently, the COVID-19-induced experiment drastically impacted transmission rates for all directly-transmitted respiratory diseases, clearly showing how impactful cultural practices are when it comes to disease spread.\n\n\n\n\n\nA. Prevalence of rhinovirus infections in Australia in 2019 (pre-COVID-19) and 2020 (where COVID-19-related lockdowns were enforced). During most of the lockdown period of 2020, rhinovirus prevalence approached zero. Data from Jones (2020). B. Prevalence of influenza A in the U.S. from 2018 through 2021. Mid-2020, the prevalence of the common flu fell to a record low, and the typical surge in flu prevalence over the winter was absent for the 2020/2021 flu season. Data from Peek (2021).\n\n\n\n\nCultural practices that prevent disease spread differ for pathogens with other rates of transmission. For example, the use of condoms and other safer sex practices are critical to curb the spread of HIV and other sexually transmitted diseases. Proper sanitary and waste water management practices, as well as the provisioning of clean drinking water, helps to limit infections from waterborne pathogens. And the distribution of insect repellents, mosquito nets, and mosquito-proof housing can drastically reduce the prevalence of vector-borne diseases, like malaria. Although the general approaches to limit disease transmission differ from pathogen to pathogen, and individual action has direct benefits (i.e., you reduce your risk of contracting a disease by social distancing, wearing a mask, using a condom, or sleeping under a mosquito net), the larger-scale public health benefits hinge on the collective action of many people in a population. A significant negative impact on pathogen fitness can only be expected when a substantial segment of the population adheres to practices that limit transmission. However, if they do, R0 can be pushed below 1, and the pathogen disappears from the population. In many cases, measures that reduce pathogen transmission have proven to be sweeping successes. For example, our ability to provide clean drinking water even when natural disasters disable sanitation and waste water management has lead to stark reductions in outbreaks of waterborne diseases.\n\n\n25.3.2 Vaccination and Herd Immunity\nThe fitness of a pathogen can also be reduced by reducing the density of susceptible hosts in a population. In theory, we could just safeguard the recovery of infected individuals; as more people get immune after overcoming an infection, the R0 of the pathogen gradually gets smaller. However, letting a disease run its natural course not only comes with huge public health and economic costs, but rapidly spreading pathogens have a large mutational input into the population, potentially leading to the emergence of novel strains that can overcome the acquired immunity of recovered hosts.\nVaccines are a much more effective way of managing the density of susceptible individuals in a population. Compared to uncontrolled disease spread, vaccination is much less costly both from a public health and an economic perspective. For example, the risk for severe neurologic or allergic side effects associated with the MMR vaccine—one of the most common vaccines that protects against measles, mumps, and rubella—is 5.3 per 100,000 fully vaccinated people. Among 1.8 million people that received the vaccine, only one death was putatively—not conclusively—linked to MMR vaccination. In comparison, prior to the 1960s when the MMR vaccine was first introduced, there were 3-4 million measles cases in the US every year, including 48,000 hospitalizations, 1,000 cases of associated encephalitis, and 500 deaths. Over 186,000 children annually were diagnosed with mumps, with many suffering from permanent deafness as a consequence. And an estimated 12.5 million people contracted rubella, causing 11,000 pregnant women to lose their babies, 2,100 newborn deaths, and 20,000 babies born with congenital rubella syndrome, which can cause life-long health issues. Rigorous MMR vaccination campaigns have caused a massive decline in the prevalence of measles, mumps, and rubella, to the point where measles was declared eliminated from U.S. in 2000, after the absence of disease transmission for over 12 months. Similarly, vaccination has lead to the global extinction of smallpox—a vicious disease with death rates around 30 %—in 1980.\nThe reason why diseases with high vaccination coverage disappear is because the reduction in the density of susceptible individuals pushes the pathogen’s R0 below 1; rather than spreading in a population, a pathogen outbreak now contracts. Importantly, not all individuals in a populations have to be vaccinated to curb disease spread and cause pathogen extinction—only enough people so that R0 is smaller than 1. Using Equation (ref?)(eq:47), the proportion of the population that needs to be vaccinated to push R0 below 1 is given by the herd immunity threshold (HIT):\n\\[\\begin{align}\nHIT=1-\\frac{1}{R_0}=1-\\frac{⍺+ν}{β} (\\#eq:47)\n\\end{align}\\]\nSince HIT is directly dependent on R0, diseases with a higher R0 require higher rates of vaccination (Figure @ref(fig:hit)). However, once HIT is reached and the pathogen’s R0 is smaller than 1, the phenomenon of “herd immunity” emerges. Since a pathogen can no longer spread in a population that has reached HIT, even individuals that are not vaccinated by the pathogen experience a significant reduction in the likelihood of infection. This is important from a public health perspective because comprehensive vaccination of eligible individuals helps to protect vulnerable segments of the population that do not have the privilege of immunization, including young children and immunocompromised people.\n\n\n\n\n\nHeard immunity threshold (HIT) as a function of a pathogen’s R0. Values for influenza A, polio, chicken and smallpox, as well as measles are indicated by gray lines.\n\n\n\n\nOverall, the development and administration of vaccines has been a sweeping success with far-reaching public health benefits. For example, despite various setbacks in the rollout of the COVID-19 vaccination campaign in 2021, the effects of vaccination on disease prevalence became evident within just a few months. By August, states with vaccination rates above 50 % exhibited below average hospitalization rates (Figure @ref(fig:vax)A). In contrast, every state with an above-average hospitalization rate also exhibited low levels of vaccination coverage. Hence, collective buy-in and action of a majority are crucial to impact disease dynamics in a significant way and produce the desired public health outcomes. The importance of coordinated responses is illustrated by the recent resurgence of measles in the U.S. Even though this disease was considered eliminated in 2000, measles has made a significant comeback over the past decade. Significant outbreaks have been recorded in the Pacific northwest, California, New York, New Jersey, and Michigan, with over 1,200 cases reported in 2019. These outbreaks have, in part, been facilitated by drops in vaccination rates (Figure @ref(fig:vax)B) inspired by anti-vaccination myths that are rooted in superstition and propagated by dubious entities with ulterior motives.\n\n\n\n\n\nA. Relationship between COVID-19 vaccination coverage and the number of hospitalizations in U.S. in August of 2021. The red dot indicates the nation-wide avagerage. Data compiled by WSJ from Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (vaccination rates) and the Deptartment of Health and Human Services (hospitalizations). B. Relationship between the percent vaccination and the number of hospitalizations for measles cases in the U.S. Data from Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n25.3.3 Pathogen Responses\nOne of the most important consequences of successful disease management—whether through the reduction of transmission or the reduction of susceptible individuals in the population—is that we exert selection on a pathogen to evolve a lower virulence. When variables in the numerator of the R0 equation are controlled through cultural practices, a parameter that a population of pathogens still has control over is the virulence, which is in the denominator. So, only decreases in virulence will cause an increase in R0, and if extrinsic factors reduce R0 below 1, pathogen strains exhibiting mutations conferring a lower virulence should have a higher fitness than those with higher virulence.\nPaul Ewald was among the first to popularize the idea that successfully managing pathogen fitness could lead to the evolution of pathogens with reduced virulence. For example, he provided some circumstantial evidence in the 1990s that HIV was evolving a lower virulence in response to the spread of safer sex practices. Later analyses of a well-studied HIV outbreak in rural Uganda indeed provided evidence that the trade-off between virulence and transmission explains the gradual attenuation of HIV through time (Figure @ref(fig:hivevol)).\n\n\n\n\n\nEvolution of virulence in HIV-1 across time. Reductions in disease transmission have selected for viral strains with lower virulence. Data from Blanquart et al. (2016).\n\n\n\n\nIn summary, being an active participant in public health measures that target disease transmission and aim to increase the number of resistant individuals in a population has three important benefits: (1) protection and minimized disease risk for yourself; (2) herd immunity that provides protection for community members that may not be able to protect themselves; and (3) elimination of pathogens from populations, or—when that is not attainable—selection for pathogen strains with reduced virulence. Approaching disease dynamics and public health issues from evolutionary perspectives has direct applications that are complementary to curative care, which focuses on healing people once they have contracted a disease. Or, as Bill Hamilton highlighted the importance of evolution in public health:\n\n“It opens our eyes to many quite weird possibilities about disease that most medical scientists, tending to be unaware of current evolutionary thought, don’t think of.” —Bill Hamilton",

    "section": "25.4 Antibiotic Resistance",
    "text": "25.4 Antibiotic Resistance\nBesides emerging diseases, the evolution of antibiotic-resistant bacteria is another major public health issue faced by our society. Antibiotics are antimicrobial substances—many of which are naturally produced by fungi and other organisms—that kill or inhibit the growth of bacteria but not eukaryotic cells. These properties make them applicable for the prophylaxis and treatment of bacterial infections. The mechanisms by which antibiotics work vary widely, but they generally interfere with essential biochemical and physiological pathways that mediate the function of microbial cells. Some antibiotics target the cell wall or the cell membrane; other disrupt the synthesis of microbial DNA or RNA, proteins, or specific metabolites. The discovery and application of antibiotics—starting with Fleming’s discovery of penicillin—transformed medicine and has allowed for the efficient treatment of bacterial diseases that, previously, were often lethal.\nThe molecular precision with which antibiotics interfere with microbial function is simultaneously one of their biggest weaknesses. Unlike sterilization treatments that apply heat, alcohol, or other cleaning supplies to kill bacterial cells outright, bacteria can evolve adaptations that render antibiotics ineffective or even nonfunctional, thus becoming resistant to their effects. Adaptations that mediate antibiotic resistance include enzymes that metabolize and inactivate antibiotics, modification of targets that make them inert to the effects of antibiotics, modifications of the cell wall that prevent the influx of antibiotics into the cell, and transmembrane transport proteins that can pump antibiotics out of the cell.\nDue to their biochemical effects, antibiotics are a source of selection that impact pathogen evolution. The presence of antibiotics increases the fitness of certain genetic variants (those that have resistance alleles), while it decreases the fitness of others (those that lack the resistance alleles). Hence, antibiotics are a source of selection that causes the spread of antibiotic resistant strains in a population.\nThe broad application of antibiotics in human and veterinary medicine, as well as in livestock production, has lead to a rapid spread of resistant strains across the globe. For example, the prevalence of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), which is responsible for a variety of difficult-to-treat infections in humans, has increased exponentially since the early 1990s (Figure @ref(fig:abres)A). There are an estimated 500,000 hospitalizations annually for MRSA infections in the U.S. alone. Of these, about 80,000 cases include severe invasive infections, leading to 11,000 deaths. Considering the death toll, and that the cost of a MRSA-associated hospitalization is over $90,000 per patient, the public health and economic impacts of antibiotic-resistant bacterial pathogens are profound. More importantly, we have also observed the evolution of multi-resistant strains that can evade the effects of multiple antibiotics. Even in rural regions of developing countries, over 92 % of isolated bacterial strains are resistant against certain antibiotics, and 5 % of strains are resistant to combination treatments of seven different antibiotics at once (Figure @ref(fig:abres)B). Simultaneous resistance to multiple types of antibiotics significantly curtails treatment options, and as a consequence, infections that were easy to treat are becoming lethal problems once again. This problem is exacerbated by the fact that the evolution of antibiotic resistance far outpaces the rate at which we are discovering and developing new antibiotics for clinical use. In fact, the last new class of antibiotics we use in medicine today was discovered in 1987—more than 30 years (almost 900,000 bacterial generations) ago.\n\n\n\n\n\nA. Prevlanece of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) in the U.S. from 1993-2005. Data from CDC. B. Prevalence of antibiotic-resistant bacteria in a rural community of India. Data are presented for different types of antibiotics and for different combination treatments. Data from Singh et al. (2018).\n\n\n\n\nThe rapid spread of antibiotic-resistant bacteria is primarily a consequence of the broad application of antibiotics. For many decades, antibiotics have been mis- and overused in human medicine and beyond. Such misuses include the inappropriate prescription of antibiotics for viral diseases (flu and cold), failure to take antibiotics for the prescribed course of a treatment, and the excessive intake of antibiotics as a prophylactic. The widespread use of antibiotics causes susceptible strains to disappear, while strains with a mutation conferring resistance benefited from a fitness advantage and became more prevalent. A key question, from an evolutionary perspective, is how we can exert selection on antibiotic strains to favor the maintenance of susceptible strains in a population, so that we can effectively treat infections when they occur.\nKey to the solution of this problem is that antibiotic resistance does not come without costs. In absence of antibiotics, resistant strains typically have a lower fitness than susceptible strains. This is likely caused by metabolic inefficiencies and physiological costs associated with resistance mechanisms that reduce microbial growth. Costs associated with antibiotic resistance become evident when we compare the growth rate of resistant bacteria to the growth rates of sensitive strains that are otherwise genetically identical. A recent meta analysis for different types of antibiotics revealed that most resistant strains exhibit a lower fitness than their sensitive counterparts, although the magnitude of difference varies substantially (Figure @ref(fig:anri)A). In addition, there is a correlation between the degree of resistance (measured as the minimum inhibitory concentration, MIC) and the fitness costs of resistance in absence of an antibiotic (Figure @ref(fig:anri)B); i.e., the higher the antibiotic concentration a bacterial strain can tolerate, the lower the fitness of that strain is when competing with sensitive strains in an antibiotic-free environment.\n\n\n\n\n\nA. Relative fitness of antibiotic-strains in absence of the antibiotic relative to an equivalent strain that is susceptible. Data is presented for different types of antibiotics, and the gray line indicates equal fitness of the reistant and susceptible strains. Data from Melnyk et al. (2015). B. Correlation between the degree of antibiotic resistance and the relative fitness cost; higher resistance is associated with a lower fitness in the absence of an antibiotic. Data from Melnyk et al. (2015).\n\n\n\n\nGiven the cost of antibiotic resistance, a primary defense against the spread of resistant strains is to create an environment where susceptible strains have a competitive advantage. Not surprisingly, “The ICU Book”—the primary guide for critical care medicine—states that “the first rule of antibiotics is to try not to use them, and the second rule is try not to use too many of them”. Recognition of the growing problem with antibiotics in the 1990s led some countries to implement restrictions on antibiotic use and launch aggressive campaigns to educate both medical professionals and the the general public about how we curb the spread of resistant strains. In Belgium, for example, these efforts led to a decrease in antibiotic prescription by 36 % from 1998 to 2007. As a consequence, the prevalence of antibiotic resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae started to decrease substantially starting in the year 2000 (Figure @ref(fig:sucs)). Similarly, erythrimycin-resistant S. pyogenes decreased in prevalence from 17 % to 2 % within just six years (Figure @ref(fig:sucs)). These findings highlight that the spread of resistant strains is reversible, and how proper management of antibiotics can help to prevent issues with resistant strains. Getting the antibiotic-resistance problem under control now is critical, especially because the costs of tolerance—upon which successful management strategies hinge—can decline over time through adaptive evolution (see R exercise).\n\n\n\n\n\nPrevalence of antibiotic resistant Streptococcus species in Belgium.

    "text": "25.5 Reflection Questions\n\nIn the seminal paper “The dawn of Darwinian Medicine”, George Williams and Randolph Nesse (1991) stated: “Conventional wisdom has it that prolonged host-parasite association leads to a gradual reduction in virulence, with obligate mutualism as the final stage of extended association”. What assumptions underlie this conventional wisdom? Why may those assumptions not hold up to scrutiny?\nPathogens require a minimum host population size to persist. If a host population is too small, the rate at which infected hosts die or become immune to a pathogen is too high, leading the to the extinction of the pathogen. How would you predict a pathogen to evolve if it were to survive in a small host population?\nOur discussion of disease dynamics has assumed that the outcome of the interaction between a host and a pathogen is solely dependent on traits that a controlled by either the host or the pathogen. What other factors—biotic or abiotic—might influence pathogen spread and evolution in natural populations? How might the spread of diseases and the evolution of virulence change when other factors are also at play?\nFrom an evolutionary perspective, what is the difference between an antibiotic and disinfectants that you can find in cleaning and medical supplies? Why do we not see the evolution of disinfectant-resistant microbes?\nHow can the use of antibiotics in animal production pose a risk to humans?\nWhat could we do if we wanted antibiotic resistance to evolve as fast as possible?",
